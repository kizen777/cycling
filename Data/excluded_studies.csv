Misalignment between circadian timing system and daily rhythms of food intake adversely impacts metabolic regulatory mechanisms and cardiovascular function. Restricting the daily EW by imposing an eating-fasting cycle through time-restricted eating (TRE) can restore robust circadian rhythms, support cellular metabolism, and improve cardiometabolic health. The aim of this study was to assess a feasibility of 12-week TRE intervention with self-selected 10 h EW and effects of TRE on EW duration, cardiometabolic outcomes, daily rhythms of behavior, and wellbeing in Polish patients with MetS and EW ≥ 14 h/day. Dietary intake was monitored with a validated myCircadianClock application (mCC app). Adherence to TRE defined as the proportion of days recorded with mCC app in which participants satisfied 10-h TRE was the primary outcome. A total of 26 patients (aged 45 ± 13 years, 62% women, 3.3 ± 0.5 MetS criteria, EW 14 ± 1.5 h/day) were enrolled. Coexistence of increased waist circumference (WC) (96% of patients), elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (77%), and elevated blood pressure (BP) (69%) was the most common MetS pattern (50%). TRE intervention (mean duration of 81.6 ± 12.6 days) led to reducing daily EW by 28% (p < 0.0001). Adherence to TRE was 87 ± 13%. Adherence to logging food intake on mCC app during TRE was 70 ± 27%. Post TRE, a decrease in body weight (2%, 1.7 ± 3.6 kg, p = 0.026), body mass index (BMI) (1%, 0.5 ± 1.2 kg/m2, p = 0.027), WC (2%, 2.5 ± 3.9 cm, p = 0.003), systolic BP (4%, 4.8 ± 9.0 mmHg, p = 0.012), FPG (4%, 3.8 ± 6.9 mg/dL, p = 0.037), glycated hemoglobin (4%, 0.2 ± 0.4%, p = 0.011), mean fasting glucose level from continuous glucose monitor (CGM) (4%, 4.0 ± 6.1 mg/dL, p = 0.002), and sleepiness score (25%, 1.9 ± 3.2 points, p = 0043) were observed. A significant decrease in body weight (2%), BMI (2%), WC (3%), mean CGM fasting glucose (6%), sleepiness score (27%), and depression score (60%) was found in patients with mean post-TRE EW ≤ 10 h/day (58% of total), and not in patients with EW > 10 h/day. Adherence to TRE was higher in patients with post-TRE EW ≤ 10 h/day vs. patients with EW > 10 h/day (94 ± 6% vs. 77 ± 14%, p = 0.003). Our findings indicate that 10-h TRE was feasible in the European MetS population. TRE resulted in reducing daily EW and improved cardiometabolic outcomes and wellbeing in patients with MetS and prolonged EW. Use of the mCC app can aid in implementing TRE. This pilot clinical trial provides exploratory data that are a basis for a large-scale randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy and sustainability of TRE for reducing cardiometabolic risks in MetS populations. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms of TRE effects, including its impact on circadian rhythm disruption.",2024,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

To adapt to this energy intake pattern, organisms have developed a 24-hour rhythmic diurnal cycle over long periods, known as the circadian rhythm, or biological clock. With the gradual advancement of research on the biological clock, it has become increasingly evident that disruptions in the circadian rhythm are closely associated with the occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To further understand the progress of research on T2D and the biological clock, this paper reviews the correlation between the biological clock and glucose metabolism and analyzes its potential mechanisms. Based on this, we discuss the potential factors contributing to circadian rhythm disruption and their impact on the risk of developing T2D, aiming to explore new possible intervention measures for the prevention and treatment of T2D in the future. Under the light-dark circadian rhythm, in order to adapt to this change, the human body forms an internal biological clock involving a variety of genes, proteins and other molecules. The main mechanism is the transcription-translation feedback loop centered on the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer. The expression of important circadian clock genes that constitute this loop can regulate T2DM-related blood glucose traits such as glucose uptake, fat metabolism, insulin secretion/glucagon secretion and sensitivity in various peripheral tissues and organs. In addition, sleep, light, and dietary factors under circadian rhythms also affect the occurrence of T2DM.",2024,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

Methods: A mouse model of PCOS was established by administering dehydroepiandrosterone in combination with high fat diet, and the mouse model was given a berberine treatment. The study consisted of a blank control group (C group), a PCOS model group (M group) and a berberine treatment group (T group). During the experiment, the mice were closely monitored through timed body weight measurements and estrous cycle monitoring; intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test were done. Upon completion of the pharmacological intervention, the wet weights of liver, ovary and fat deposits of mice were assessed and subjected to HE staining to confirm the success of PCOS modeling and the efficacy of berberine. Additionally, fecal samples were analyzed for intestinal flora through 16S rRNA analysis. Results: The PCOS model was established successfully, berberine alleviated the disturbance of estrous cycle in mice, and significantly alleviated fat accumulation and metabolic abnormalities of glucose in mice. The cross-sectional area of fat pad cells in T group was (2 858±146) μm², which was significantly lower than that in M group [(9 518±347) μm²], and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). The blood glucose levels in T group were significantly lower than those in M group (P<0.05). The composition and structure of intestinal flora in mice of M group with PCOS (compared with C group) and in mice of T group after berberine intervention (compared with M group) were significantly altered. However, alpha diversity did not change significantly among three groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: Berberine could alleviate PCOS by intervening in the alterations of gut microbiota.",2024,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

Sprague-Dawley rats with normal glucose levels were randomly divided into three groups, including a conventional diet control group (Group A), high-fat-high-sugar diet model group (Group B), and DGR group (Group C, high-fat-high-sugar diet containing 20.5 g DGR). After 10 weeks of intervention, the fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2 h blood glucose [PBG; using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)], hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), plasma total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG) were tested, and the livers of rats were removed to calculate the liver index. Then, hepatic portal TG were tested using the Gross permanent optimization-participatiory action planning enzymatic method and phosphoproteomics was performed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis followed by database search and bioinformatics analysis. Finally, cell experiments were used to verify the results of phosphoproteomics. Phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4k4) and phosphorylated adducin 1 (ADD1) were detected using western blotting. DGR effectively reduced PBG, TG, and the liver index (P < 0.05), and significantly decreased HbA1c, TC, and hepatic portal TG (P < 0.01), showed significant hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, red oil O staining, and Masson staining of liver tissue. The total spectrum was 805 334, matched spectrum was 260 471, accounting for accounting 32.3%, peptides were 19 995, modified peptides were 14 671, identified proteins were 4601, quantifiable proteins were 4417, identified sites were 15 749, and quantified sites were 14659. Based on the threshold of expression fold change ( > 1.2), DGR up-regulated the modification of 228 phosphorylation sites involving 204 corresponding function proteins, and down-regulated the modification of 358 phosphorylation sites involving 358 corresponding function proteins, which included correcting 75 phosphorylation sites involving 64 corresponding function proteins relating to glycolipid metabolism. Therefore, DGR improved biological tissue processes, including information storage and processing, cellular processes and signaling, and metabolism. The metabolic functions regulated by DGR mainly include energy production and conversion, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, lipid transport and metabolism, inorganic ion transport and metabolism, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism. In vitro phosphorylation validation based on cell experiments showed that the change trends in the phosphorylation level of MAP4k4 and ADD1 were consistent with that of previous phosphoproteomics studies. DGR extensively corrects the modification of phosphorylation sites to improve corresponding glycolipid metabolism-related protein expression in rats with glycolipid metabolism disorders, thereby regulating glycolipid metabolism through a multi-target and multi-method process.",2024,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

This disease involves different organ systems and presents with a variety of clinical manifestations. Most patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced type 1 diabetes are reported to have no combination of autoimmune disease. We report a case of Sintilimab-related diabetes mellitus and psoriasis. We report a case of a 65-year-old female with Sintilimab-related diabetes mellitus and psoriasis. The patient treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (Sintilimab) for 4 cycles. The patient presented with inexplicable bouts of nausea and vomiting, accompanied by chest discomfort and a feeling of breathlessness, prompting their admission to the local hospital. The initial assessment upon admission revealed an abrupt elevation in blood glucose levels, alongside normal ketone levels, lactic acidosis, and hyperuricemia. A comprehensive regimen was provided to regulate glucose levels and address the symptoms, resulting in notable improvement and subsequent discharge. Regrettably, the patient's personal decision to discontinue medication for a single day led to the emergence of acute ketoacidosis, coupled with a recurrence of psoriasis vulgaris. Consequently, readmission became necessary. Based on the patient's medical history and diabetes antibody testing, the diagnosis of immune checkpoint inhibitor induced diabetes mellitus has been confidently established. The patient ceased treatment with Sintilimab and was initiated on insulin therapy for glycemic control, alongside symptomatic management for psoriasis. Upon stabilization of the condition, long-term administration of exogenous insulin was implemented as a substitute treatment. Outside of the hospital, insulin therapy effectively maintained stable blood glucose levels, and there were no further episodes of psoriasis flare-ups. The clinical manifestations of immune checkpoint inhibitor induced diabetes mellitus are variable, and in this case the patient presented with unique primary symptoms. Therefore, it is crucial to accumulate relevant cases, understand the different clinical presentations and identify the underlying mechanisms of the disease. This will provide further evidence for early therapeutic intervention in similar patients in the future.",2023,"① 一過性の自転車運動効果"

After interventional rats were fed with high glucose and high fat diet ad libitum for 4 weeks, intraperitoneally injected streptozotocin to induce diabetic model. According to blood glucose level,28 diabetic rats were selected and continued to be fed with high glucose and high fat diet, were stratified by body weight, and divided randomly by blood glucose into Model group (was given sterile water by gastric perfusion and injected aquae pro injection intraperitoneally), Dangua group [Dangua liquor 20.5 g·kg-1·d-1 by perfusion and aquae pro injection intraperitoneally], Inhibitor group [sterile water by perfusion and nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (Nampt) specific blocker GEN-617 1.25 mg/kg intraperitoneally], DanInhit group (Dangua liquor and GEN-617 synchronously). Control group were continuously fed with ordinary diet. The intervention was last for 10 weeks. Body weight (BW), liver index (LI), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), TC, TG, free fatty acids (FFA), creatinine (Cr), and A-ketoglutarate (α-KG), Iso-citric acid (ICA), oxaloacetic acid (OAA) were tested. The cytochrome C oxidase (COX) and Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were evaluated by Colorimetry; Nampt protein, Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase (ATPs), Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)and its reduced (NADH) in liver were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The expressions of Nampt and mitochondrialnadhdehydrogenase-1 (mt-ND1) gene in liver was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Hepatic tissue staining was also completed. The levels of BW, ICA, α-KG and Nampt-mRNA in the Model group are lower than that in the Normal group (P < 0.05), conversely, liver weight, LI, TC, HbA1c, SDH and ATPs, mt-ND1-mRNA, and Nampt protein in the Model group are higher (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Compared with Model group, the levels of ICA, Nampt-mRNA and Nampt in Dangua group are significantly increased, and FFA obviously raised (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05); liver weight, BW, SDH are obviously lower, and HbA1c decreased significantly (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). TG, FFA and Nampt protein increased in the DanInhit group, TC, TG, BW obviously increased in the Inhibitor group, but SDH is decreased in both the two groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared with Dangua group, DanInhib group has the lower levels of ICA, mt-ND1-mRNA, Nampt-mRNA, and the higher level of BW, LI and HbA1c.

To evaluate the effect of maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy on the glycolipid metabolism of offspring at different life-cycles (from birth to adulthood) and to explore the improvement of different dosages of vitamin D supplementation. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed vitamin D-deprived (VDD group) or standard vitamin D diets (SC group) during pregnancy, and their diets were changed to standard vitamin D diets during lactation (the offspring were sorted into VDDoffspring and SCoffspring groups). After weaning, rats in the VDDoffspring group were randomly assigned to the VDDoffspring, VDDoffspring-S3300 and VDDoffspring-S10000 groups with diets containing standard, medium and high dosages of vitamin D for 12 wk. Serum was collected for biochemical analyses at postnatal Day 21, postnatal Day 56 and postnatal Day 84. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at postnatal Day 70. Compared to SCoffspring, rats in the VDDoffspring group had significantly lower birth weight with faster weight gain and higher levels of lipid metabolism in early life. After near adulthood, the differences in weight and lipid metabolism between the two groups disappeared. OGTT showed significantly higher blood glucose levels in the VDDoffspring group at 30 min, 60 min, and 90 min. The continuation of vitamin D supplementation at medium and high dosages after weaning did not cause any obvious changes in weight or glycolipid metabolism (except for postprandial hyperglycemia). OGTT demonstrated that the glucose levels in the VDDoffspring-S3300 group were lowest at all the time points and that those in the VDDoffspring-S10000 group were the highest at 30 min, 60 min, and 90 min among the three groups.

It is proven that curbing the intergenerational inheritance of obesity through early intervention during the gestation period has a positive outcome on the body composition, cognitive function, and anxiety level of the offspring. A recent discovery shows that the consumption of Elateriospermum tapos (E. tapos) seed extract modulates body mass and ameliorates stress hormones in obese dams, while a probiotic bacterial strain can cross the placenta and boost a child's memory. Thus, we speculate that probiotics are the best medium to integrate plant extract (E. tapos extract) to access the effect on the child's cognition. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the early intervention of E. tapos yoghurt in obese dams in the cognition and anxiety levels of male offspring. In this study, 40 female rats were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity before pregnancy, while another 8 rats were fed with standard rat pellets for 16 weeks. Upon successful copulation, treatment was initiated for the obese dams up to the postnatal day (PND) 21. The groups included normal chow and saline (NS), HFD and saline (HS), HFD and yoghurt (HY), HFD and 5 mg/kg E. tapos yoghurt (HYT5), HFD and 50 mg/kg E. tapos yoghurt (HYT50), and HFD and 500 mg/kg E. tapos yoghurt (HYT500). All rats were euthanised on PND 21, and the body mass index (BMI), Lee index, and waist circumference were measured for the male offspring. Hippocampal-dependent memory tests and open field tests were conducted to access for cognition and anxiety status. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), total fat (%), insulin, leptin, lipid profile, and antioxidant parameter on serum and hypothalamus (FRAP and GSH) were accessed on PND 21. The result shows male offspring of 50 mg/kg-supplemented obese dams have comparable total fat (%), lipid profile, insulin level, FBG level, plasma insulin level, recognition index, low anxiety level, and improved hypothalamic FRAP and GSH levels to the normal group. In conclusion, this study highlights that the effect of early intervention of our novel formulation of E. tapos yoghurt in obese dams alleviates cognitive deficits and anxiety in male offspring by modulating metabolic profiles at the dose of 50 mg/kg.",2023,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

Diabetes is an important risk factor and a common comorbidity in AMI patients. The higher mortality risk of diabetes-AMI relative to nondiabetes-AMI indicates a need for specific treatment to improve clinical outcome. However, the global metabolic dysregulation of AMI complicated with diabetes is still unclear. We aim to systematically interrogate changes in the metabolic microenvironment immediate to AMI episodes in the absence or presence of diabetes. In this work, quantitative metabolomics was used to investigate plasma metabolic differences between diabetes-AMI (n=59) and nondiabetes-AMI (n=59) patients. A diverse array of perturbed metabolic pathways involving carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid metabolism emerged. In all, our omics-oriented approach defined a metabolic signature of afflicted mitochondrial function aggravated by concurrent diabetes in AMI patients. In particular, our analyses uncovered N-lactoyl-phenylalanine and lysophosphatidylcholines as key functional metabolites that skewed the metabolic picture of diabetes-AMI relative to nondiabetes-AMI. N-lactoyl-phenylalanine was strongly associated with metabolic indicators reflective of mitochondrial overload and negatively correlated with HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin, type A1C) specifically in hyperglycemic AMI, suggestive of its central role in glucose utilization and mitochondrial energy production instrumental to the clinical outcome of diabetes-AMI. Reductions in lysophosphatidylcholines, which were negatively correlated with blood glucose and inflammatory markers, might further compromise glucose expenditure and aggravate inflammation leading to poorer prognosis in diabetes-AMI. As circulating metabolite levels are amenable to therapeutic intervention, such shifts in metabolic signatures provide new clues and potential therapeutic targets specific to the treatment of diabetes-AMI.",2023,"① 一過性の自転車運動効果"

Substantial evidence supports the effectiveness of intermittent energy restriction (IER) in T2D management. However, there are few studies that report intermittent use of a low-calorie pre-prepared food including MFH plants and wholegrains in T2D. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Chinese Medical Nutrition Therapy (CMNT), a MFH plants and wholegrains diet accompanied by IER, on glycemic control and potential mechanism. Ten-week-old diabetic db/db mice were randomly divided into CMNT group (feeding low-calorie mouse CMNT diet in day 1-4 and ad libitum regular chow for up to 7 days per cycle) and control group (ad libitum access to regular chow). The results showed that CMNT reduced fasting blood glucose, improved glucose tolerance with higher insulin secretion, attenuated macrophage infiltration, promoted β-cell proliferation of pancreatic islets, and increased diabetes-improving microbiota (Bacteroides, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Coprococcus_1) in db/db mice. Additionally, we performed a pilot study evaluating CMNT in thirty-nine T2D patients without obesity. Participants with T2D randomly assigned to two groups: CMNT group (receiving a consecutive 5-day low-calorie human CMNT diet with 10 days of habitual eating per cycle for 90 days) and control group (continuing on a normal diet). We observed an improvement in glycemic control in CMNT group with significant reduction in HbA1c, fasting glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose but control group were not affected.

This study aimed to investigate the preventive effects of chromium (III)-enriched yeast (YCr) on high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFHFD)-induced hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in mice, and further clarify its mechanism of action from the perspective of intestinal microbiomics and liver metabolomics. The results indicated that oral administration of YCr remarkably inhibited the aberrant elevations of body weight, blood glucose and lipid levels, hepatic cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels caused by HFHFD. Liver histological examination showed that oral YCr intervention inhibited HFHFD induced liver lipid accumulation. Besides, 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing showed that YCr intervention was beneficial to ameliorating intestinal microbiota dysbiosis by altering the proportion of some intestinal microbial phylotypes. Correlation-based network analysis indicated that the key intestinal microbial phylotypes intervened by YCr were closely related to some biochemical parameters associated with glucose and lipid metabolism. Liver metabolomics analysis revealed that dietary YCr intervention significantly regulated the levels of some biomarkers involved in purine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, citrate cycle, pyrimidine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and so on. Moreover, dietary YCr intervention regulated the mRNA levels of key genes associated with glucose, cholesterol, fatty acids and bile acids metabolism in liver. These findings suggest that dietary YCr intervention has beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism by regulating intestinal microbiota and liver metabolic pathway, and thus can be served as a functional component to prevent hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia.",2022,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

Effects of acute and chronic exercise in hypoxia on cardiovascular and glycemic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review. High Alt Med Biol. 23:301-312, 2022. Background: Exercise in hypoxia (EH, decreased oxygen availability) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic intervention to promote angiogenesis and improve glucose metabolism to a greater extent than exercise under normoxia (normal ambient air) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Currently, there are no studies that systematize the existent evidence. This study aims to systematically review the literature and qualitatively evaluate the effects of acute and chronic EH on cardiovascular and glycemic parameters in T2D patients. Methods: A structured search was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines until March 2021, in the MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) randomized and nonrandomized trials, (2) in complication-free patients with T2D, (3) in which EH was compared with exercise in normoxia or with baseline data, and (4) published in English. Results: Six articles (64 subjects) met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed to data extraction. Four articles investigated the acute effect of EH (33 subjects), and two articles investigated the chronic effect of EH (31 subjects), ranging from 6 to 8 weeks. All studies used a cycle ergometer as exercise. Acute EH benefits insulin sensitivity, blood glucose, vascular endothelial growth factor, and metalloproteinase-9, while chronic EH benefits nitric oxide synthase in erythrocytes, but not brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. Conclusion: Acute EH improves glucose homeostasis in T2D patients, which was not seen with chronic EH. Both acute EH and chronic EH improve angiogenesis regulators, but not vascular function. Despite the putative benefits of EH in patients with T2D, the evidence is still scarce and further research is needed before recommendations can be provided.",2022,"① 一過性の自転車運動効果"

However, the detailed energy balance alteration caused by TRF remains unclear. This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial using a within-subject cross-over design. Twelve healthy, normal-weighted volunteers (age: 24 ± 2.3 years; BMI: 21.9 ± 1.71 kg/m2; 7 females) were studied under a rigorous control for calorie intakes, physical activities as well as sleep-wake cycle to evaluate the energy balance systematically. Each participant consumed an isocaloric diet within either a 5.5-hour TRF or 11-hour control schedule. All energy intake and excretion were traced and collected and accessed by bomb calorimetry. Energy expenditure and substrates oxidation were monitored in a metabolic chamber. TRF compared with control schedule is associated with a 22.7% increase in fecal energy loss (Δ = 32.25 ± 9.33 Kcal, p = 0.005) and a trend in increasing 14.5% urine energy loss (Δ = 6.67 ± 3.14 Kcal, p = 0.058) without change energy expenditure. In total, a negative energy balance (Δ = -45.95 ± 19.00 Kcal, p = 0.034), which was equal to -2.6% of total energy intake, has been observed during TRF interventions. In the meantime, glycemic profiles, heart rate, respiration rate as well as metabolic flexibility were also improved during TRF intervention. Taken together, our findings unravel the mystery of how TRF regulates energy balance, supporting the use of TRF as an alternative dietary strategy for weight loss.",2022,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

Since life-long pharmacotherapy with alagebrium chloride (ALT) slows progression to experimental T1D, we hypothesized that acute ALT therapy delivered prediabetes, may be effective. However, in female, non-obese diabetic (NODShiLt) mice, ALT administered prediabetes (day 50-100) did not protect against experimental T1D. ALT did not decrease circulating AGEs or their precursors. Despite this, pancreatic β-cell function was improved, and insulitis and pancreatic CD45.1+ cell infiltration was reduced. Lymphoid tissues were unaffected. ALT pre-treatment, prior to transfer of primed GC98 CD8+ T cell receptor transgenic T cells, reduced blood glucose concentrations and delayed diabetes, suggesting islet effects rather than immune modulation by ALT. Indeed, ALT did not reduce interferon-γ production by leukocytes from ovalbumin-pre-immunised NODShiLt mice and NODscid recipients given diabetogenic ALT treated NOD splenocytes were not protected against T1D. To elucidate β-cell effects, NOD-derived MIN6N8 β-cell major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class Ia surface antigens were examined using immunopeptidomics. Overall, no major changes in the immunopeptidome were observed during the various treatments with all peptides exhibiting allele specific consensus binding motifs. As expected, longer MHC Class Ia peptides were captured bound to H-2Db than H-2Kb under all conditions. Moreover, more 10-12 mer peptides were isolated from H-2Db after AGE modified bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA) treatment, compared with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or AGE-BSA+ALT treatment. Proteomics of MIN6N8 cells showed enrichment of processes associated with catabolism, the immune system, cell cycling and presynaptic endocytosis with AGE-BSA compared with BSA treatments.

A baseline audit carried out on an acute stroke ward at a District General Hospital in East Kent showed variability in blood tests being requested on admission for patients who had a suspected stroke, in particular serum glucose and cholesterol levels. Our aim was to ensure that at least 80% of patients admitted to the stroke ward with a suspected stroke had blood glucose and cholesterol levels measured on admission, over an 18-week period.The percentage of patients admitted with a suspected stroke on the ward who had the appropriate investigations requested on admission was measured weekly. Quality improvement methodology was used to formulate three interventions in the form of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles: (1) an educational email sent to doctors regarding the assessment of patients who had a stroke and admission blood tests required; (2) adaptation of the 'Stroke Admission Clerking Proforma' to include a list of bloods to be requested; (3) production of an all-inclusive 'Stroke Bloods Panel' on the online system for requesting bloods.At baseline, an average of 30% and 34% of patients had glucose and cholesterol levels requested on admission, respectively. These results increased to 43% and 40% after the first intervention; 71% and 61% after the second intervention; and after the final intervention, on average, 82% and 85% of patients had glucose and cholesterol levels requested, respectively. We therefore achieved our aim of ensuring that more than 80% of patients who had an acute stroke had the appropriate blood tests requested on admission.The modified stroke proforma and the blood panel were the most effective interventions. The changes were implemented in an additional hospital within the same Trust. We anticipate greater compliance with Royal College of Physicians (RCP), National Institute for Health & Care Excellence (NICE) and Trust guidelines regarding appropriate and timely prescription of antidiabetic and cholesterol-lowering medications for secondary preventative measures.",2021,"① 一過性の自転車運動効果"

Since anxiolytic drugs target mitochondria, non-pharmacological approaches to improve mitochondrial metabolism such as intermittent fasting (IF) may cause parallel behavioral benefits against anxiety disorders. Here, we investigated whether a chronic IF regimen could induce anxiolytic-like effects concomitantly to modulation in mitochondrial bioenergetics and trophic signaling in mice brain. A total of 44 Male C57BL/6 J mice (180 days old) were assigned to two dietary regimens: a normal, ad libitum diet (AL group) and an alternate-day fasting (IF group), where animals underwent 10 cycles of 24 h food restriction followed by 24 h ad libitum access. Animals underwent the open field test, dark/light box and elevated plus maze tasks. Isolated nerve terminals were obtained from mice brain and used for mitochondrial respirometry, hydrogen peroxide production and assessment of membrane potential dynamics, calcium handling and western blotting. We showed that IF significantly alters total daily food intake and food consumption patterns but not body weight. There were no differences in the exploratory and locomotory parameters. Remarkably, animals from IF showed decreased anxiety-like behavior. Mitochondrial metabolic responses in different coupling states and parameters linked with H2O2 production, Ca2+ buffering and electric gradient were not different between groups. Finally, no alterations in molecular indicators of apoptotic death (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio) and neuroplasticity (proBDNF/BDNF and synaptophysin were observed). In conclusion, IF exerts anxiolytic-like effect not associated with modulation in synaptic neuronergetics or expression of neurotrophic proteins.

The identification of other biomarkers could provide an alternative or adjunct diagnostic method, to allow early intervention before laminitis develops. The present study characterised the metabolome of ponies with varying degrees of ID using basal and postprandial plasma samples obtained during a previous study, which examined the predictive power of blood insulin levels for the development of laminitis, in ponies fed a high-sugar diet. Samples from 10 pre-laminitic (PL - subsequently developed laminitis) and 10 non-laminitic (NL - did not develop laminitis) ponies were used in a targeted metabolomic assay. Differential concentration and pathway analysis were performed using linear models and global tests. Significant changes in the concentration of six glycerophospholipids (adj. P ≤ 0.024) and a global enrichment of the glucose-alanine cycle (adj. P = 0.048) were found to characterise the response of PL ponies to the high-sugar diet. In contrast, the metabolites showed no significant association with the presence or absence of pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction in all ponies. The present results suggest that ID and laminitis risk are associated with alterations in the glycerophospholipid and glucose metabolism, which may help understand and explain some molecular processes causing or resulting from these conditions. The prognostic value of the identified biomarkers for laminitis remains to be investigated in further metabolomic trials in horses and ponies.",2021,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

Sixteen (eight males and eight females) recreationally active individuals, aged (mean ± SD) 22 ± 7 years, participated with a seven-day period between interventions. The high-intensity interval exercise trial consisted of twelve, 30 s cycling intervals at 80% of peak power capacity and 90 s active recovery. The resistance exercise trial consisted of four sets of 10 repetitions for three lower-limb exercises at 80% 1-RM, matched for duration of high-intensity interval exercise. Exercise was performed after an overnight fast, with blood samples collected every 30 min, for two hours after exercise. There was a significant interaction between time and intervention for glucose (p = 0.02), which was, on average (mean ± SD), 0.7 ± 0.7 mmol∙L-1 higher following high-intensity interval exercise, as compared to resistance exercise. Cortisol concentration over time was affected by intervention (p = 0.03), with cortisol 70 ± 103 ng∙mL-1 higher (p = 0.015), on average, following high-intensity interval exercise.

In fact, PTDM is a risk factor for both infection and cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence and incidence of PTDM have a bimodal evolution: early (up to 3 months) and late PTDM (beyond 12 months). The majority of late PTDM occurs in subjects with prediabetes after transplantation. So, treating patients with prediabetes, a potentially reversible condition, might help preventing PTDM. In the general population, exercise prevents the evolution from prediabetes to diabetes. However, in renal transplantation, not enough evidence is available in this field. We designed an exploratory analysis to evaluate the feasibility of exercise to reverse prediabetes as a first step in the design of a trial to prevent PTDM. Only patients with prediabetes beyond 12 months after transplantation with capacity to perform exercise will be included. Prediabetes will be diagnosed based on fasting glucose levels and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). Patients will be treated with a stepped training intervention, starting with aerobic exercise training (brisk walking, swimming, and cycling) 5 times per week and 30 min/day. Aerobic exercise training will be gradually increased to 60 min/day or eventually combined with anaerobic exercise training in case of persistent prediabetes.

Ambient hyperglycemia has been implicated in this exercise response heterogeneity. The current study investigated whether pre-exercise hyperglycemia directly impacts the effect of exercise on glycemic control. Twelve healthy normal glucose-tolerant males completed four trials in a randomized, crossover design. Each trial consisted of 24-h pre-intervention monitoring, a 7-h intervention, and 24-h post-intervention monitoring. Glycemic control was measured throughout the study by continuous glucose monitoring. The four interventions were no exercise (CON) or 45 min of cycling exercise (70%HRmax) preceded by 3.5 h of either normoglycemia (NG-Ex), steady-state hyperglycemia induced by constant glucose infusion (HG-Ex) or fluctuating glycemia induced by repeated glucose bolus infusions (FG-Ex). Physical activity and diet were similar between trials, and energy expenditure during exercise was matched between exercise trials (all P > 0.05). Mean glucose during the 3.5 h ± infusion period was higher in HG-Ex (mean ± SEM; 7.2 ± 0.4 mmol/L) and FG-Ex (7.3 ± 0.3 mmol/L) compared to CON (4.8 ± 0.2 mmol/L) and NG-Ex (5.0 ± 0.2 mmol/L) trials (P < 0.01). Glycemic variability was greatest in FG-Ex (P < 0.01). Following the interventions, the postprandial glucose response (iAUC) was reduced by exercise in NG-Ex compared to CON (321.1 ± 38.6 vs. 445.5 ± 49.7 mmol/L.8h, P < 0.05, d=0.81). This benefit was blunted when exercise was preceded by steady-state (HG-Ex, 425.3 ± 45.7 mmol/L.8h) and fluctuating (FG-Ex, 465.5 ± 39.3 mmol/L.8h) hyperglycemia (both P > 0.05 vs. CON).

Huanglian Decoction (HLD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) preparation that has been used to treat T2DM for thousands of years in China. However, its mechanism of action at the metabolic level is still unclear. The purpose of this work is to study the mechanism of HLD in treating T2DM based on metabolomics and network pharmacology. In this study, metabolomics combined with network pharmacology was used to elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of HLD in T2DM. Serum samples were collected from rats with T2DM, induced by a high-sugar and high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin (STZ), to measure the levels of biochemical markers. Urinary metabolomics-based analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was conducted to evaluate the differential metabolites from multiple metabolic pathways. After treatment with HLD for 4 weeks, biochemical indicators, including fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood lipid, fasting insulin (FINS), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), were significantly improved. Metabolomics results revealed that HLD regulated the biomarkers, such as cytosine, L-carnitine, betaine, phenylalanine, glucose, citrate, phenylpyruvate, and hippuric acid in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The combination of network pharmacology, metabolomics, western blot, and PCR showed that HLD can treat T2DM by enhancing the gene and protein expression levels of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), insulin receptor (INSR), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) to interfere with glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.

PLA interventions have been effective in addressing population level health problems in low income country contexts, and therefore we sought to use this approach to engage communities to identify and address community barriers to prevention and control of type 2 diabetes. We used a mixed methods approach collecting quantitative data through field reports and qualitative data through observations and focus group discussions. Through descriptive analysis, we considered fidelity to the participatory approach and implementation plans. One hundred twenty-two groups per month were convened by 16 facilitators and supervised by two coordinators. Groups worked through a four phase PLA cycle of problem identification, planning together, implementation and evaluation to address the risk factors for diabetes - diet, physical activity, smoking and stress. Groups reported a lack of awareness about diabetes prevention and control, the prohibitive cost of care and healthy eating, and gender barriers to exercise for women. Groups set targets to encourage physical activity, kitchen-gardening, cooking with less oil, and reduced tobacco consumption. Anti-tobacco committees operated in 90 groups. One hundred twenty-two groups arranged blood glucose testing and 74 groups organized testing twice. Forty-one women's groups established funds, and 61 communities committed not to ridicule women exercising. Experienced and committed supervisors enabled fidelity to a participatory methodology. A longer intervention period and capacity building could enable engagement with systems barriers to behaviour change.

The present study aimed to evaluate the metabolic effects of LBP on the urine and liver metabolomics on a high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model. After 8 weeks of high-fat diet and streptozotocin induction of diabetes, 24 diabetic rats were randomly allocated to the diabetic control (DC) group, LBP low, moderate, and high dosage (LBP-L, LBP-M, LBP-H) groups and 6 non-diabetic rats were established as the non-diabetic control (NDC) group for 30 days' intervention. Metabolomics was performed on liver and urine. LBP positively regulated fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin-A1c, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, liver glycogen and SOD levels significantly, as compared to the DC group. Liver metabolomics showed higher levels of myo-inositol and lower levels of L-malic acid, fumaric acid, D-arabitol, L-allothreonine 1, xylitol, O-phosphorylethanolamine, ribitol, 5-methoxytryptamine 2 and digitoxose 2 in the LBP-H group vs. the DC group, which indicates that LBP may regulate the citrate cycle, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. Urine metabolomics showed increased levels of creatinine, D-galacturonic acid 2, 2,3-dihydroxybutyric acid and citric acid, and decreased levels of methylmalonic acid, benzoic acid and xylitol between the LBP-H and DC groups. The present study exhibited the effects of LBP on the urine and liver metabolomics in a high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced rat model, which not only provides a better understanding of the anti-diabetic effects of LBP but also supplies a useful database for further specific mechanism study.",2019,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

The role of non-pharmacological interventions to prevent these outcomes has been reported in many systematic reviews, but robust conclusions have not been made due to variations in the scope, quality and findings of these reviews. Our aim was to provide an overview of existing evidence on the effects of non-pharmacological interventions in women with PCOS on fertility and non-fertility outcomes by a review of existing systematic reviews. We reviewed systematic reviews of randomized trials that have evaluated the effects of non-pharmacological interventions, such as lifestyle interventions, nutritional supplements or alternative medicine therapies in women with PCOS on fertility, endocrine, glycaemic and weight-related outcomes. We assessed the quality of systematic reviews with the AMSTAR tool, and reported the outcomes with regard to: fertility (live birth, clinical pregnancy, ovulation and menstrual cycle regularization); endocrine outcomes (Ferriman-Gallwey score, free androgen index, free testosterone and total testosterone levels); and glycaemic (fasting blood insulin, fasting blood glucose, homoeostatic model assessment) and weight-related (BMI) outcomes. We assessed the strength of evidence for significant outcomes as per the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) system. We found twelve eligible systematic reviews which included between three (143 women) and 27 randomized trials (2093 women). Four reviews assessed the effects of lifestyle interventions (diet, physical activity and/or behavioural interventions); four evaluated nutritional supplements (one each on n-acetylcysteine, omega-3 fatty acids, inositol and vitamin D); and four studied alternative medical therapies (Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture). All of the included reviews were of high quality and scored between 8 and 11 with the AMSTAR tool (with a maximum score of 11).Randomized evidence is lacking for live birth rate. N-acetylcysteine, inositol and the addition of alternative medicine to ovulation induction agents show preliminary potential to improve fertility (odds ratios (OR) for clinical pregnancy rate range from 1.99 to 4.83). Lifestyle interventions show benefits in improving hirsutism (mean difference (MD): -1.01 to -1.19). Lifestyle interventions (MD: -1.10 to -2.02), inositol (MD: -2.1) and acupuncture (MD: -1.90 to -3.43) all show some evidence of improvement in glycaemic outcomes and there is some evidence of reduced BMI with lifestyle interventions (MD: -0.15 to -1.12). All of these outcomes scored either low or very low quality of evidence on the GRADE score. Lifestyle interventions in women with PCOS appear to improve glycaemic results, androgenic symptoms and anthropometric outcomes. The role of inositol and N-acetylcysteine in women with PCOS needs further evaluation. Large primary trials on all interventions are needed for an agreed set of core outcomes.",2019,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

To maximize its use for clinical management, the most effective modality should be identified. The purpose of this review is to elucidate the most effective modality of exercise on insulin sensitivity and blood glucose control in pregnant women with or at risk of GDM. A search was undertaken in MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Embase and the Maternity & Infant Healthcare Database. Studies that met inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials and case-controlled studies, which compared exercise interventions with standard care during pregnancy in women with or at risk of GDM. Two interventions using resistance training, eight using aerobic exercise and two using a combination of both modalities were included. The interventions showed consistently that requirements of insulin therapy, dosage, and latency to administration were improved in the exercise groups. Less consistent results were observed for capillary blood glucose measurements; however, both modalities and combination of modalities were effective at improving blood glucose control in already diagnosed patients and pregnant women with obesity. Discrepancies in the timing of intervention, GDM diagnostic criteria, and the different measures used to assess glucose metabolism make it difficult to draw clear recommendations. Exercising three times per week for 40-60 min at 65-75% age-predicted heart rate maximum using cycling, walking or circuit training as a modality improved glycaemic control in GDM patients and reduced incidence of GDM in pregnant women with obesity. Further studies looking specifically at the effects of different modalities of exercise on glucose metabolism with combined strategies to enhance insulin sensitivity should be explored to maximize benefits for GDM pregnancies. Consistency in design and delivery of exercise-only interventions is required to make recommendations on a suitable exercise prescription in this population. In practice, adherence to consensus in diagnostic cut-offs for GDM diagnosis is fundamental for standardizing future research.",2018,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

29369529,"Bloomgarden Zachary","Diabetes and branched-chain amino acids: What is the link?","Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have increasingly been studied as playing a role in diabetes, with the PubMed search string ""diabetes"" AND ""branched chain amino acids"" showing particular growth in studies of the topic over the past decade (Fig. ). In the Young Finn's Study, BCAA and, to a lesser extent, the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine were associated with insulin resistance (IR) in men but not in women, whereas the gluconeogenic amino acids alanine, glutamine, or glycine, and several other amino acids (i.e. histidine, arginine, and tryptophan) did not show an association with IR. Obesity may track more strongly than metabolic syndrome and diabetes with elevated BCAA. In a study of 1302 people aged 40-79; higher levels of BCAA tracked with older age, male sex, and metabolic syndrome, as well as with obesity, cardiovascular risk, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and uric acid. Medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines, by-products of mitochondrial catabolism of BCAAs, as well as branched-chain keto acids and the BCAA themselves distinguished obese people having versus not having features of IR, and in a study of 898 patients with essential hypertension, the BCAA and tyrosine and phenylalanine were associated with metabolic syndrome and impaired fasting glucose. In a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies, elevations in BCAA and, to a lesser extent, in alanine tracked with IR, whereas higher levels of glutamine and glycine were associated with lesser likelihood of IR. Given these associations with IR, it is not surprising that a number of studies have shown higher BCAA levels in people with and prior to development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), although this has particularly been shown in Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups while not appearing to occur in African Americans. Similarly, higher BCAA levels track with cardiovascular disease. [Figure: see text] The metabolism of BCAA involves two processes: (i) a reversible process catalysed by a branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT), either cytosolic or mitochondrial, requiring pyridoxal to function as an amino group carrier, by which the BCAA with 2-ketoglutarate produce a branched-chain keto acid plus glutamate; and (ii) the irreversible mitochondrial process catalysed by branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) leading to formation of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA from leucine, valine, and isoleucine, respectively, which enter the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle as acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively, leading to ATP formation. The BCAA stimulate secretion of both insulin and glucagon and, when given orally, of both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), with oral administration leading to greater and more prolonged insulin and glucagon secretion. Insulin may particularly reduce BCAA turnover to a greater extent than that of other amino acids, and decreases the appearance and increases the uptake of amino acids. However, older studies of the effect of glucose or insulin on BCAA concentrations and rates of leucine appearance and oxidation showed no reduction in T2D, although the higher baseline levels of BCAA in obesity have long been recognized. Impaired function of BCAT and BCKDH has been posited, either as a primary genetic abnormality or due to effects of elevated fatty acids, proinflammatory cytokines, or insulin levels with consequent accumulation of branched-chain keto acids and metabolites such as diacylglycerol and ceramide, potentially contributing to the development of further insulin resistance, and decreased skeletal muscle BCAT and BCKDH expression has been shown in people with diabetes, supporting this concept. A Mendelian randomization study used measured variation in genes involved in BCAA metabolism to test the hypothesis of a causal effect of modifiable exposure on IR, showing that variants in protein phosphatase, Mg2+ /Mn2+ dependent 1K (PPM1K), a gene encoding the mitochondrial phosphatase activating the BCKDH complex, are associated with T2D, but another such study suggested that genetic variations associated with IR are causally related to higher BCAA levels. Another hypothesis involves the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is activated by BCAA, as well as by insulin and glucose via cellular ATP availability. If this is the relevant pathway, BCAA overload may cause insulin resistance by activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as by leading to increases in acylcarnitines, with mTOR seen in this scenario as a central signal of cross-talk between the BCAA and insulin. At this point, whether whole-body or tissue-specific BCAA metabolism is increased or decreased in states of insulin-resistant obesity and T2D is uncertain. Insulin action in the hypothalamus induces but overfeeding decreases hepatic BCKDH, leading to the concept that hypothalamic insulin resistance impairs BCAA metabolism in obesity and diabetes, so that plasma BCAAs may be markers of hypothalamic insulin action rather than direct mediators of changes in IR. A way to address this may be to understand the effects of changes in diet and other interventions on BCAA, as well as on IR and T2D. In an animal model, lowering dietary BCAA increased energy expenditure and improved insulin sensitivity. Two large human population studies showed an association of estimated dietary BCAA intake with T2D risk, although another population study showed higher dietary BCAA to be associated with lower T2D risk. Ethnic differences, reflecting underlying differences in genetic variants, may be responsible for such differences. In the study of Asghari et al. in the current issue of the Journal of Diabetes, BCAA intake was associated with the development of subsequent IR. Studies of bariatric surgery suggest lower basal and post-insulin infusion BCAA levels are associated with greater insulin sensitivity, with reductions in BCAA not seen with weight loss per se with gastric band procedures, but occurring after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, an intervention that may have metabolic benefits over and above those from reduction in body weight. The gut microbiota may be important for the supply of the BCAA to mammalian hosts, either by de novo biosynthesis or by modifying nutrient absorption. A final fascinating preliminary set of observations is that of the effects of empagliflozin on metabolomics; evidence of increased Krebs cycle activation and of higher levels of BCAA metabolites, such as acylcarnitines, suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition may, to some extent, involve BCAA metabolism. Certainly, we do not yet have a full understanding of these complex associations. However, the suggestion of multiple roles of BCAA in the development of IR promises to be important and to lead to the development of novel effective T2D therapies.",2018,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

The aim of this study was to identify the degree to which high-fat diet-induced obesity would alter the daily rhythm of gut peptide plasma levels (glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1], peptide YY [PYY], insulin or amylin [AMY]) or meal-induced levels in the middle of the light or dark cycle. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet (OBESE) or chow (LEAN), implanted with jugular catheters, and blood samples were taken every 2 h throughout the light/dark cycle while freely feeding or after an Ensure liquid meal. We found that even when OBESE and LEAN animals ate the same kcals and have a similar pattern of food intake, there is a difference in both the levels and rhythm of plasma gut peptides. GLP-1 and PYY are higher during the light cycle in LEAN animals and AMY is higher in the OBESE group throughout the light/dark cycle. There was also a differential response of plasma gut signals after the Ensure meal, even though the composition and amount of intake of the meal were the same in both groups. These changes occur prior to the high-fat diet induced loss of glycemic control and may be a target for early intervention. Impact statement The aim of this study was to test if obesity would alter the daily rhythm of gut peptides or meal-induced levels in the middle of the light or dark cycle. We found that even when animals are eating the same amount (in kcal) of food that the obese animals have altered daily rhythms and meal-induced gut peptide levels. In particular, we are the first to show that obesity induces increases in peptide YY levels during the light cycle and amylin remains high throughout the light and dark cycle in obese animals. These changes occurred prior to a loss of glycemic control. Thus, the rhythm of gut peptides could be used as an early indicator of later and more serious metabolic disturbances and may be a target for early intervention.",2017,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

Moreover, long-term walking training effects on PV remain unknown. Seventeen male and 10 female subjects (~69 yr), having performed IWT for ≥24 months before the study, were used. After pre-intervention measurement (PRE) of PV, plasma albumin content (Albcont), fasting glucose concentration ([Glc]f), and HbA1c, the subjects were randomly divided into two groups: CHO and Pro-CHO, either consuming CHO (22.5 g) alone or CHO (15 g) + whey protein (10 g), respectively, during additional 5-month IWT from May to November, 2009. After the additional IWT, we measured the same variables again (postintervention measurement). The baseline PV and Albcont were significantly correlated with the number of IWT days for the 12 months preceding PRE (r = 0.716, P < 0.001 and r = 0.671, P < 0.001, respectively). In postintervention, PV and Albcont marginally decreased in CHO from the baselines (P = 0.081 and P = 0.130, respectively) with increased HbA1c (P < 0.001) after correction for the baseline [Glc]f by ANCOVA, but these values remained unchanged in Pro-CHO (both, P > 0.74), with significant differences in the changes between groups (P = 0.020, P = 0.041, and P = 0.018 respectively). PV was proportional to the number of IWT days for 12 months and a CHO + whey protein supplementation during the 5-month IWT prevented PV reduction for the period of no supplementation, which might be partially linked with blood glucose control mechanisms.",2018,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

The objectives and primary outcomes of this study were: (1) to assess the efficacy of interval walking training (IWT) and continuous walking training (CWT) on S G and insulin sensitivity (S I) in individuals with type 2 diabetes; and (2) to assess the association of changes in S G and S I with changes in glycaemic control. Fourteen participants with type 2 diabetes underwent three trials (IWT, CWT and no training) in a crossover study. Exclusion criteria were exogenous insulin treatment, smoking, pregnancy, contraindications to structured physical activity and participation in recurrent training (>90 min/week). The trials were performed in a randomised order (computerised-generated randomisation). IWT and CWT consisted of ten supervised treadmill walking sessions, each lasting 60 min, over 2 weeks. IWT was performed as repeated cycles of 3 min slow walking and 3 min fast walking (aiming for 54% and 89% of [Formula: see text], respectively, which was measured during the last minute of each interval), and CWT was performed aiming for a moderate walking speed (73% of [Formula: see text]). A two-step (pancreatic and hyperinsulinaemic) hyperglycaemic clamp was implemented before and after each trial. All data were collected in a hospitalised setting. Neither participants nor assessors were blinded to the trial interventions. Thirteen individuals completed all procedures and were included in the analyses. IWT improved S G (mean ± SEM: 0.6 ± 0.1 mg kg-1 min-1, p < 0.05) but not S I (p > 0.05), whereas CWT matched for energy expenditure and time duration improved neither S G nor S I (both p > 0.05). Changes in S G, but not in S I, were associated with changes in mean (β = -0.62 ± 0.23, r 2 = 0.17, p < 0.01) and maximum (β = -1.18 ± 0.52, r 2 = 0.12, p < 0.05) glucose levels during 24 h continuous glucose monitoring. Two weeks of IWT, but not CWT, improves S G but not S I in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, changes in S G are associated with changes in glycaemic control. Therefore, increased S G is likely an important mechanism by which training improves glycaemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Mouse models of FGR were established by low protein diet feeding of the pregnant mice. Both the newborn female mice with FGR and normal control (NC) mice were randomized for feeding with a standard diet (SF) or a high-fat diet (HF) after weaning and treatment with gavage of either metformin or normal saline. The mice were examined for vaginal opening time and the estrous cycle at the age of 8 weeks. At the age of 12 weeks, 6 mice in anestrus from each group were fasted for 12 h for measurement of body weight, height, poundera index (PI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (Fins), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), and the HOMA-IR was calculated. The reproductive capacity of female mice was assessed by mixing them with male mice at the ratio of 2:1. The 3 × 2 factorial analysis was conducted to determine the interactions between FGR, high-fat feeding and metformin. Factorial analysis showed that FGR and high-fat feeding had significant effects on the PI index, Fins, HOMA-IR, vaginal opening time, and AMH (P<0.05). Metformin significantly affected the factors related to high-fat feeding including weight, PI, FPG, Fins, HOMA-IR and estrous cycle (P<0.05) and the factors related to FGR with the exception of height and FSH (P<0.05). FGR significantly affected the factors tested except for body weight (P<0.05); high-fat feeding affected all the factors but the FSH (P<0.05); metformin affected all the factors but the height and FSH (P<0.05). In the female mice treated with saline, the pregnancy rates differed significantly between FGR mice with high-fat feeding and control mice with standard feeding, and between FGR mice with standard feeding and high-fat feeding (P<0.05). FGR mice can present with delayed puberty with rare ovulation and adulthood insulin resistance, and high-fat feeding after birth can promote the catch-up growth of FGR mice.

A multidisciplinary team managed a 3-week residential programme characterised by the integration of nutritional and physical rehabilitation with psychological and educational intervention. All patients consecutively admitted in 10 months were analysed at admission and discharge for changes in the following domains: anthropometry (weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and neck circumferences), cardiovascular risk factors (glycaemia, HbA1c, lipid profile, blood pressure), quality of life, eating behaviour, and physical performance (VO2peak by incremental cycle ergometer test, 6-min walking test (6MWT), chair stands test). 136 subjects (61% females, median age 52.7 years) with obesity (mean BMI 43.2 kg/m2) and multiple comorbidities were analysed. A 3.9% BMI reduction and a reduction in waist (-3.8%) and neck (-3.3%) circumferences were observed. Glycaemic control was achieved in 68% of patients with uncontrolled diabetes at admission. Blood pressure control was achieved in all patients with uncontrolled hypertension at admission. Total cholesterol (-16%), LDL-cholesterol (-19%) and triglycerides (-9%) were significantly reduced. Psychometric assessment showed improvements in quality of life perception and binge eating disorder. Finally, a significant improvement in physical performance (+4.7% improvement in VO2peak, with longer distances in 6MWT and a higher number of standings) was observed.

In comparison to a no exercise control trial (CON), the area under curve (AUC) of plasma glucose was reduced with both RES and SIE (P < 0.05), while insulin AUC was only reduced with RES. Cederholm, Gutt, Matsuda, and HOMA indices were improved (P < 0.05) following RES compared to CON. Corresponding changes following SIE were only found in Cederholm and Gutt indices (P < 0.05).

Recently, it has been suggested that heat may augment the negative effect of mental fatigue on cognitive performance, raising the question whether it may also amplify the effect of mental fatigue on TT performance. In 30°C and 30% relative humidity, 10 endurance-trained male athletes (mean ± SD; age = 22 ± 3 yr, Wmax = 332 ± 41 W) completed two experimental conditions: intervention (I; 45-min Stroop task) and control (C; 45-min documentary). Pre- and postintervention/control, cognitive performance was followed up with a 5-min Flanker task. Thereafter, subjects cycled for 45 min at a fixed pace equal to 60% Wmax, immediately followed by a self-paced TT in which they had to produce a fixed amount of work (equal to cycling 15 min at 80% Wmax) as fast as possible. Self-reported mental fatigue was significantly higher after I compared with C (P < 0.05). Moreover EEG measures also indicated the occurrence of mental fatigue during the Stroop (P < 0.05). TT did not differ between conditions (I = 906 ± 30 s, C = 916 ± 29 s). Throughout exercise, physiological (HR, blood lactate, core, and skin temperature) and perceptual measures (perception of effort and thermal sensation) were not affected by mental fatigue. No negative effects of mild mental fatigue were observed on performance and the physiological and perceptual responses to endurance exercise in the heat.

After a 2-h recovery period, blood sampling was repeated. Elites consumed other beverages in later phases. Dietary intake and fasting triglyceride, cholesterol, blood sugar, lactate dehydrogenase, and F2-isoprostane concentrations were determined. Data were analyzed with a simple repeated-measures test and post-hoc tests using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. Data showed that cholesterol levels non-significantly decreased after intervention. Triglyceride level was lower after taking dough and carbohydrate replacement drink. Blood glucose concentration increased after intervention periods, however, this increase was significant only after non-alcoholic beverage consumption. Lactate dehydrogenase levels reduced after all cycles, however, F2-isoprostane level showed no significant change. There was not significant change in lactate dehydrogenase and F2-isoprostane levels. Non-alcoholic beer consumption can reduce lactate dehydrogenase concentration; however, it leads to blood sugar increase.

The study determined the effects of two forms of exercise training on the abundance of two proteins, (glucose transporter-4 [GLUT-4], adenosine monophosphate kinase [AMPK]) involved in glucose utilization and the transcriptional coactivator that regulates the genes involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) coactivator 1 alpha [PGC-1α]), in muscles in men with chronic motor-complete spinal cord injury (SCI). Clinical trial at a Medical Center. Nine men with chronic motor-complete SCI participated in functional electrical stimulation lower extremity cycling (FES-LEC; n = 4) or arm cycling ergometer (arm-cycling ergometer [ACE]; n = 5) 5 days/week for 16 weeks. Whole body composition was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. An intravenous glucose tolerance test was performed to measure glucose effectiveness (Sg) and insulin sensitivity (Si). Muscle biopsies of the right vastus lateralis (VL) and triceps muscles were collected one week prior to and post the exercise training intervention. Neither training intervention altered body composition or carbohydrate metabolism. GLUT-4 increased by 3.8 fold in the VL after FES training and increased 0.6 fold in the triceps after ACE training. PGC-1α increased by 2.3 fold in the VL after FES training and 3.8 fold in the triceps after ACE training. AMPK increased by 3.4 fold in the VL after FES training and in the triceps after ACE training. FES-LEC and ACE training were associated with greater protein expressions in the trained muscles by effectively influencing the abundance of GLUT-4, AMPK and PGC-1α. Thus, FES-LEC training of paralyzed muscle can modulate protein expression similar to that of trained and innervated muscle.",2017,"④ 重度の疾患者を対象"
27695119,"Jakobsen Ida; Solomon Thomas P J; Karstoft Kristian","The Acute Effects of Interval-Type Exercise on Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes Subjects: Importance of Interval Length. A Controlled, Counterbalanced, Crossover Study.","Interval-type exercise is effective for improving glycemic control, but the optimal approach is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of the interval length on changes in postprandial glycemic control following a single exercise bout. Twelve subjects with type 2 diabetes completed a cross-over study with three 1-hour interventions performed in a non-randomized but counter-balanced order: 1) Interval walking consisting of repeated cycles of 3 min slow (aiming for 54% of Peak oxygen consumption rate [VO2peak]) and 3 min fast (aiming for 89% of VO2peak) walking (IW3); 2) Interval walking consisting of repeated cycles of 1 min slow and 1 min fast walking (IW1) and 3) No walking (CON). The exercise interventions were matched with regards to walking speed, and VO2 and heart rate was assessed throughout all interventions. A 4-hour liquid mixed meal tolerance test commenced 30 min after each intervention, with blood samples taken regularly. IW3 and IW1 resulted in comparable mean VO2 and heart rates. Overall mean postprandial blood glucose levels were lower after IW3 compared to CON (10.3±3.0 vs. 11.1±3.3 mmol/L; P < 0.05), with no significant differences between IW1 (10.5±2.8 mmol/L) and CON or IW3 and IW1 (P > 0.05 for both). Conversely blood glucose levels at specific time points during the MMTT differed significantly following both IW3 and IW1 as compared to CON. Our findings support the previously found blood glucose lowering effect of IW3 and suggest that reducing the interval length, while keeping the walking speed and time spend on fast and slow walking constant, does not result in additional improvements.

Onion, a so-called functional food, is noted to affect the insulin signaling pathway of diabetes in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of consuming fresh yellow onions on insulin-related indices compared with a low-onion-containing diet among breast cancer (BC) patients treated with doxorubicin. This parallel-design, randomized, triple-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted on 56 eligible BC patients (aged 30-63 years), diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. Following their second cycle of chemotherapy, subjects were assigned in a stratified-random allocation to receive body mass index-dependent 100 to 160 g/d of onion as high onion group (HO; n = 28) or 30 to 40 g/d small onions in low onion group (LO; n = 28) for 8 weeks intervention. Participants, care givers, and those who assessed laboratory analyses were blinded to the assignments (IRCT Registry No.: IRCT2012103111335N1). The compliance level of participants in the analysis was as high as 87.85%. A total of 23 available cases was analyzed in each group. The daily use of HO resulted in a significant decrease in serum fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in comparison with LO, over the period of study ( P < .001). Posttreatment with HO showed a significant decrease in homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance relative to changes in the LO group ( P < .05). A comparison of the changes that occurred throughout pre- and postdose treatments indicated improved quantitative insulin sensitivity check index ( P < .05) and controls on C-peptide in the HO group ( P < .05). The present study demonstrated the effectiveness of onion to ameliorate hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in BC during doxorubicin-based chemotherapy.",2017,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"
27239306,"Thompson Sarah; Jones Rhian","A Quality Improvement Project to Assess Timing of Initial Investigations in Stroke Medicine.","There are several investigations that can be completed in the acute phase of admission for patients with suspected stroke.These include receiving a CT Head scan and also blood tests specific for stroke. The national guidelines regarding CT Head scans detail they should be completed within 12 hours of admission(1) and the trust guidelines, local to where this quality improvement project was based, advise a CT Head should be completed within four hours of admission.(2) The current national guidelines do not specify exact stroke blood tests, however trust guidelines give a specific set of blood tests that would be appropriate to be taken when a patient presents to A&E with a suspected stroke. These included FBC, U&E, blood glucose, ESR, cholesterol, TFTs, and coagulation screen.(2) The aim of this quality improvement project was to assess the timing of CT Head scans and blood tests and to implement a tool to ensure these are done in a timely fashion, within the emergency care setting. The project was completed through three PSDA cycles. The first was undertaken in an A&E department, which was soon to be closed and moved to a different site. The second cycle was then completed at the new site, to assess if there had been any change in timings of these interventions. In the previous site it was found that 97% of patients audited received a CT Head scan within four hours. At the new site it was found 94% patients received a CT Head within four hours, therefore both meeting trust targets on the whole. A full set of stroke blood tests were completed at the old site in 53% of patients and this decreased to 22% of patients at the new site. At this point it was decided an intervention should be implemented to ensure this did not continue. The intervention used was updating a stroke panel on the trust computer system (an easy to use, one-click button entitled ""Stroke/TIA"") with the correct blood tests and the use of this was promoted throughout the trust. A post-intervention audit was completed three months after the tool was promoted and patients receiving the correct blood tests whilst in the A&E department increased to 75%. The amount of patients receiving a CT Head scan within four hours was 100% therefore meeting both trust and national guidelines. In conclusion, the stroke blood panel appears to have improved the amount of patients receiving the correct blood tests when admitted with suspected stroke and will continue to stay in place at the trust.",2016,"① 一過性の自転車運動効果"

This study investigated the effects of an educational program with emphasis on physical exercise on biological health markers of subjects with type 2 DM (T2DM). This was a quasi-experimental study with subjects who attended a diabetes education program over one year. At the beginning, middle and end of the annual cycle, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile and anthropometry were measured. The program offered two hours of educational and exercise interventions twice a week. Before and after each session capillary blood glucose (BG) was measured. Statistical analysis used Pearson's χ2, paired t, ANOVA-RM and MANOVA tests to compare results with significance levels set at P<0.05. Data of 103 subjects (73% women) were analyzed. Mean age was 64.1±10.8 years and 23% of participants were on insulin therapy. As an acute effect mean BG decreased significantly (P<0.001) from 157.5±61.5 mg/dL to 128.5±47.5 mg/dL after the intervention sessions, also resulting in increased prevalence of normoglycemic BG (from 44.0% to 68.6%).

Sixteen elite athletes (8 male, 8 female, 24 ± 8 yrs) were randomly assigned into 2 training groups performing either 2 session per week of treadmill running or ergometer cycling in addition to 3 skating specific sessions (technique, plyometrics, parkour) for 8 weeks. Training intensity was determined within non-specific (cycling or running) and effects on specific endurance capacity within a specific incremental exercise test. Before and after the intervention all athletes performed a specific (300m) and one non-specific (30s cycling or 200m running) all-out sprint test according to the group affiliation. To determine the accumulation of blood lactate (BLa) and glucose (BGL) 20 μl arterialized blood was drawn at rest, as well as in 1 min intervals for 10 min after the sprint test. The sport-specific peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) was significantly increased (+17%; p = 0.01) in both groups and highly correlated with the sprint performance (r = -0.71). BLa values decreased significantly (-18%, p = 0.02) after the specific sprint test from pre to post-testing without any group effect. However, BGL values only showed a significant decrease (-2%, p = 0.04) in the running group. The close relationship between aerobic capacity and sprint performance in inline speed skating highlights the positive effects of endurance training. Although both training programs were equally effective in improving endurance and sprint capacities, the metabolic results indicate a faster recovery after high intensity efforts for all athletes, as well as a higher reliance on the fat metabolism for athletes who trained in the running group. Key pointsIn addition to a highly developed aerobic performance inline speed skaters also require a highly trained anaerobic capacity to be effective in the sprint sections such as the mass start, tactical attacks and finish line sprint.An 8-week low-intensity endurance training program of either cycling or running training combined with additional routine training improves classical aerobic characteristics (17% increase of VO2 peak), as well as values for acceleration and speed.Athletes who trained in the running group demonstrated a higher reliance on the fat metabolism in the sport-specific post-testing.The significant reduction in anaerobic ATP turnover during repeated sprints appears to be partially compensated by an increase in VO2 in subsequent sprint. The results revealed a close relationship between the aerobic capacity and sprint performance in inline speed skating.",2016,"② トップアスリートを対象"

This study assessed post-exercise glycaemic profiles of non-exercising individuals with insulin treated type 2 diabetes, following resistance and aerobic exercise. Randomised cross-over trial. Fourteen individuals with insulin treated type 2 diabetes (9 males, 5 females) aged 58.1±7.1 years (HbA1c: 8.0±0.6%) were allocated to single sessions of resistance (six whole-body exercises, three sets, 8-10 repetitions, 70% 1RM) and aerobic (30min cycling, 60% VO2peak) exercise, 7-days apart, with the day prior to the first exercise day of each intervention being the control condition. Immediately prior to exercise, insulin dosage was halved and breakfast consumed. Continuous glucose monitoring was undertaken to determine area under the curve and glucose excursions. Blood glucose initially increased (0-2h) following both resistance and aerobic exercise (p<0.001), peaking at 12.3±3.4mmolL(-1) and 12.3±3.3mmolL(-1), respectively. Area under the glucose curve was not statistically different over any of the 24h periods (p=0.12), or different in response to resistance (222±41mmolL(-1)24h(-1)) or aerobic (211±40 mmolL(-1)24h(-1)) exercise (p=0.56). Incidence of hyperglycaemia did not differ between exercise modes (p=0.68). Hypoglycaemic events were identified in three and four participants following resistance and aerobic exercise respectively: these did not require treatment. Glycaemic response is not different between exercise modes, although 50% insulin dose reduction prior to exercise impairs the expected improvement. A common clinical recommendation of 50% insulin dose reduction does not appear to cause adverse glycaemic events.",2016,"① 一過性の自転車運動効果"

We retrospectively identified 95 obese patients at their entry into a 9-month Med and HIIT program: 21 were trained on a water-immersed ergocycle and 74 on a standard dryland ergocycle. Body composition, cardiometabolic and exercise parameters were measured before and after the program. For obese patients performing water- and dryland-exercise (mean age 58±9 years versus 55±7 years), BMI was higher for the water- than dryland-exercise group (39.4±8.3kg/m(2) versus 34.7±5.1kg/m(2), P<0.05), and total fat mass, fasting glycemia and triglycerides level were higher (P<0.05).

Twenty-eight subjects were allocated to one of two groups: HIIT, which performed three sessions per week of four high-intensity cycling intervals, or a control group (CON), which maintained their normal level of physical activity. Diet was controlled for all subjects to ensure weight stability. Pre- and postintervention (pre/post), subjects completed an incremental cycling test to limit of tolerance and, following a 10-day high-fat controlled feeding period, a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to determine insulin sensitivity and substrate oxidation. Nine members of HIIT (age, 29 ± 4 yr; body mass, 90.1 ± 13.8 kg) and eleven members of CON (age, 30 ± 7 yr; body mass, 85.5 ± 10.7 kg) completed the study.

It is characterized by a generalized reduction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of calorie restriction and ketogenic diet on neuroblastoma tumor growth and monitor potential adaptive mechanisms of the cancer's oxidative phosphorylation system. Xenografts were established in CD-1 nude mice by subcutaneous injection of two neuroblastoma cell lines having distinct genetic characteristics and therapeutic sensitivity [SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2)]. Mice were randomized to four treatment groups receiving standard diet, calorie-restricted standard diet, long chain fatty acid based ketogenic diet or calorie-restricted ketogenic diet. Tumor growth, survival, metabolic parameters and weight of the mice were monitored. Cancer tissue was evaluated for diet-induced changes of proliferation indices and multiple oxidative phosphorylation system parameters (respiratory chain enzyme activities, western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and mitochondrial DNA content). Ketogenic diet and/or calorie restriction significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in the xenograft model. Neuroblastoma growth reduction correlated with decreased blood glucose concentrations and was characterized by a significant decrease in Ki-67 and phospho-histone H3 levels in the diet groups with low tumor growth. As in human tumor tissue, neuroblastoma xenografts showed distinctly low mitochondrial complex II activity in combination with a generalized low level of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, validating the tumor model. Neuroblastoma showed no ability to adapt its mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity to the change in nutrient supply induced by dietary intervention. Our data suggest that targeting the metabolic characteristics of neuroblastoma could open a new front in supporting standard therapy regimens. Therefore, we propose that a ketogenic diet and/or calorie restriction should be further evaluated as a possible adjuvant therapy for patients undergoing treatment for neuroblastoma.",2015,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

However, the metabolic response to exercise training is variable, and the precise clinical and molecular determinants that mark the metabolic improvements remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis that clinical improvements in glucose control after low-intensity exercise in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are coupled to alterations in skeletal muscle gene expression. We investigated 14 overweight individuals with IGT before and after a 4-month low-intensity unsupervised walking exercise intervention. Clinical and anthropometric measurements and glucose tolerance were determined before and after the intervention. Skeletal muscle biopsy specimens were obtained for mRNA expression analysis. Waist circumference and work capacity during cycle ergometry were improved in individuals who achieved normal glucose tolerance (NGT) after exercise training (IGT-NGT; n = 9) but in not individuals who remained IGT (IGT-IGT; n = 5). Pretraining glycemic control was better in IGT-NGT compared with IGT-IGT. mRNA expression of mitochondrial markers and transcription factors was increased in IGT-NGT after exercise intervention and normalized to levels measured in a separate cohort of nonexercised individuals with NGT. Conversely, these markers were unaltered after exercise intervention in IGT-IGT. Normalization of metabolic control can be achieved after low-intensity exercise in individuals with IGT. This can be tracked with increased mRNA expression of mitochondrial and metabolic genes in skeletal muscle.

This is particularly the case for patients with multivessel coronary disease who are treated with percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). A considerable part of the IHD population are subjects with metabolic syndrome (MetS) who participate in comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CCR) programs as a part of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. To evaluate prospectively conventional risk factors within MetS, including uric acid (UA) level, in men with IHD after PCI or CABG who participated in ambulatory CCR. The study included 90 adult men (mean age 59.1 ± 7.31 years) with IHD after PCI (n = 63, 70%) or CABG (n = 27, 30%) referred for ambulatory CCR on average 30-60 days after an acute coronary syndrome. All subjects were examined twice 2 months apart - at the referral for CCR and after completion of CCR. MetS was diagnosed based on the measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference (WC), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and fasting blood glucose levels. In all subjects, UA level was also measured and the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI) were calculated. Following clinical evaluation and exercise test, each patient underwent 24 interval training sessions on a cycle ergometer. The patients received drug therapy including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, and acetylsalicylic acid. As a part of CCR, the patients also received education regarding healthy lifestyle changes including physical activity, healthy diet, stress coping techniques, effects of nicotine and alcohol, and effective methods to eliminate these habits. In most subjects, WC, BMI and WHR did not change significantly after the period of 2 months of CCR, and WC and BMI increased in the CABG subgroup (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.0178, respectively). Irrespective of the type of cardiac intervention, significant increases in exercise capacity and physical effort tolerance were observed after 2 months of CCR (p < 0.00001). TG level increased in all participants (p = 0.0514) and in the PCI subgroup (p = 0.0489). Systolic blood pressure decreased in all participants (p = 0.0216) and in the PCI subgroup (p = 0.0043). Mean UA level also decreased in all patients regardless of the type of cardiac intervention. Overall, the proportion of patients with the diagnosis of MetS did not change significantly after 2 months of CCR (36% vs. 31%, p > 0.05). However, the rate of MetS decreased in the PCI subgroup (from 46% to 29%, p = 0.043) and increased in the CABG subgroup (from 11% do 37%, p = 0.0562). The effect of participation in CCR on the metabolic risk in men with IHD varies depending on the type of earlier cardiac intervention. The metabolic risk decreased in patients treated with PCI, while it increased in those treated with CABG. In order to reduce the metabolic risk, particularly in CABG patients, a CCR program requires intensification of the patient support including educational activities regarding diet and weight reduction as well as individually prescribed physical activity.",2015,"① 一過性の自転車運動効果"

Determinants of changes in IS and insulin secretion with weight cycling in non-obese healthy subjects remain unclear. In a 6wk controlled 2-stage randomized dietary intervention 32 healthy men (26±4y, BMI: 24±2kg/m2) followed 1wk of overfeeding (OF), 3wks of caloric restriction (CR) containing either 50% or 65% carbohydrate (CHO) and 2wks of refeeding (RF) with the same amount of CHO but either low or high glycaemic index at ±50% energy requirement. Measures of IS (basal: HOMA-index, postprandial: Matsuda-ISI), insulin secretion (early: Stumvoll-index, total: tAUC-insulin/tAUC-glucose) and potential endocrine determinants (ghrelin, leptin, adiponectin, thyroid hormone levels, 24h-urinary catecholamine excretion) were assessed. IS improved and insulin secretion decreased due to CR and normalized upon RF. Weight loss-induced improvements in basal and postprandial IS were associated with decreases in leptin and increases in ghrelin levels, respectively (r = 0.36 and r = 0.62, p<0.05). Weight regain-induced decrease in postprandial IS correlated with increases in adiponectin, fT3, TSH, GL of the diet and a decrease in ghrelin levels (r-values between -0.40 and 0.83, p<0.05) whereas increases in early and total insulin secretion were associated with a decrease in leptin/adiponectin-ratio (r = -0.52 and r = -0.46, p<0.05) and a decrease in fT4 (r = -0.38, p<0.05 for total insulin secretion only). After controlling for GL associations between RF-induced decrease in postprandial IS and increases in fT3 and TSH levels were no longer significant. Weight cycling induced changes in IS and insulin secretion were associated with changes in all measured hormones, except for catecholamine excretion. While leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin seem to be the major endocrine determinants of IS, leptin/adiponectin-ratio and fT4 levels may impact changes in insulin secretion with weight cycling.

Glucose transporter type I deficiency (G1D) is commonly associated with seizures and with electrographic spike-waves. The G1D syndrome has long been attributed to energy (ie, adenosine triphosphate synthetic) failure such as that consequent to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate depletion. Indeed, glucose and other substrates generate TCAs via anaplerosis. However, TCAs are preserved in murine G1D, rendering energy-failure inferences premature and suggesting a different hypothesis, also grounded on our work, that consumption of alternate TCA precursors is stimulated and may be detrimental. Second, common ketogenic diets lead to a therapeutically counterintuitive reduction in blood glucose available to the G1D brain and prove ineffective in one-third of patients. To identify the most helpful outcomes for treatment evaluation and to uphold (rather than diminish) blood glucose concentration and stimulate the TCA cycle, including anaplerosis, in G1D using the medium-chain, food-grade triglyceride triheptanoin.

Fourteen children and adults with G1D who were not receiving a ketogenic diet were selected on a first-come, first-enrolled basis. Supplementation of the regular diet with food-grade triheptanoin. First, we show that, regardless of electroencephalographic spike-waves, most seizures are rarely visible, such that perceptions by patients or others are inadequate for treatment evaluation. Thus, we used quantitative electroencephalographic, neuropsychological, blood analytical, and magnetic resonance imaging cerebral metabolic rate measurements. One participant (7%) did not manifest spike-waves; however, spike-waves promptly decreased by 70% (P = .001) in the other participants after consumption of triheptanoin. In addition, the neuropsychological performance and cerebral metabolic rate increased in most patients. Eleven patients (78%) had no adverse effects after prolonged use of triheptanoin. Three patients (21%) experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, and 1 (7%) discontinued the use of triheptanoin. Triheptanoin can favorably influence cardinal aspects of neural function in G1D.

PATIENTS diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=10, no withdrawals) participated in the study. Subjects performed three 1-hour interventions: 1) interval walking (IW; repeated cycles of 3 min of slow and fast walking); 2) continuous walking (CW); and 3) control (CON). Oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured continuously to match mean VO2 between exercise sessions (∼75% VO2peak). A mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT; 450 kcal, 55% carbohydrate) with stable glucose isotopic tracers was provided after each intervention, and glucose kinetics were measured during the following 4 hours. Free-living glycemic control was assessed for approximately 32 hours after the MMTT using continuous glucose monitoring. VO2 was well matched between the exercise interventions. IW decreased the mean and maximal incremental plasma glucose during the MMTT when compared with the CON (mean 1.2 ± 0.4 vs 2.0 ± 0.5 mmol/L, P < .001; maximal 3.7 ± 0.6 vs 4.6 ± 0.7 mmol/L, P = .005) and mean when compared with CW (1.7 ± 0.4 mmol/L, P = .02).

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is proposed as a crucial disease mechanism in obese and insulin-resistant animals (such as ob/ob mice) with simple steatosis, but its role in NASH remains controversial. We therefore evaluated the role of ER stress as a disease mechanism in foz/foz mice, which develop both the metabolic and histological features that mimic human NASH. We explored ER stress markers in the liver of foz/foz mice in response to a high-fat diet (HFD) at several time points. We then evaluated the effect of treatment with an ER stress inducer tunicamycin, or conversely with the ER protectant tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), on the metabolic and hepatic features. foz/foz mice are obese, glucose intolerant and develop NASH characterized by steatosis, inflammation, ballooned hepatocytes and apoptosis from 6 weeks of HFD feeding. This was not associated with activation of the upstream unfolded protein response [phospho-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) activity and spliced X-box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1)]. Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and up-regulation of activating transcription factor-4 (Atf4) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (Chop) transcripts were however compatible with a 'pathological' response to ER stress. We tested this by using intervention experiments. Induction of chronic ER stress failed to worsen obesity, glucose intolerance and NASH pathology in HFD-fed foz/foz mice. In addition, the ER protectant TUDCA, although reducing steatosis, failed to improve glucose intolerance, hepatic inflammation and apoptosis in HFD-fed foz/foz mice.

Onion significantly decreased the levels of total cholesterol within each group; however, these changes were stronger in the high-onion group (weighted mean differences [WMD]: -5.60 [95% confidence interval [CI]: -9.16, -2.03]; P=0.003) than in the low-onion group (WMD: -6.42 [95%CI: -11.97, -0.87]; P=0.025). Similarly, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly (WMD: -5.13 [95%CI: -9.46, -0.81); P=0.022) in the high-onion group, and (WMD: -2.90 [95%CI -5.57, -0.21]; P=0.035) in the low-onion group after treatment. The levels of fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein (a) did not differ significantly after 8-week onion treatment. Adjustment for confounders did not make any significant changes in any of the parameters in post-treatment levels. Raw red onion consumption appears to be effective as a cholesterol-lowering food agent in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. However, further investigation is warranted.",2014,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

Furthermore, many women remain sedentary during pregnancy because of perceived barriers to exercise participation. This study examined the effectiveness of a home-based cycling program commenced upon diagnosis of GDM on daily fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the response of glucose and insulin to a 75-g oral glucose load. Forty sedentary women (28.8 ± 0.9 wk of gestation) were randomized to either home-based exercise training in combination with conventional management (EX, n = 20) or to conventional management alone (CON, n = 20) until week 34 of pregnancy. Mean compliance to the supervised exercise training was 96%, and no adverse effects were reported. Capillary glucose concentration was acutely reduced in response to each cycling session (6.3 ± 0.8 mM to 4.9 ± 0.7 mM, P < 0.001). Overall, the EX group had lower mean daily postprandial glucose concentrations throughout the intervention compared with that in the CON group (P < 0.05) despite consuming a greater proportion of dietary carbohydrate (P < 0.05). No differences were observed between groups with respect to HbA1c or the glucose and insulin response to oral glucose ingestion postintervention (P > 0.05). A home-based cycling program may help to maintain daily postprandial normoglycemia in women with diet-controlled GDM.",2014,"① 一過性の自転車運動効果"

In fact, it has been suggested that the disruption of the circadian system may play a causal role in manifestations of MetS. The aim of this research was to find out whether habitual consumption of a low-fat diet, compared with a Mediterranean diet enriched with olive oil, modulates the associations between common CLOCK single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1801260, rs3749474 and rs4580704) and lipid and glucose-related traits among MetS patients. Plasma lipid and insulin concentrations, indexes related with insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI)) and CLOCK SNPs were determined in 475 MetS subjects participating in the CORDIOPREV clinical trial (NCT00924937). Gene-diet interactions were analyzed after a year of dietary intervention (Mediterranean diet (35% fat, 22% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) versus low-fat diet (28% fat, 12% MUFA)). We found significant gene-diet interactions between rs1801260 SNP and the dietary pattern for insulin concentrations (p = 0.009), HOMA-IR (p = 0.014) and QUICKI (p = 0.028). Specifically, after 12 months of low-fat intervention, subjects who were homozygous for the major allele (TT) displayed lower plasma insulin concentrations (p = 0.032), lower insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; p = 0.027) and higher insulin sensitivity (QUICKI; p = 0.024) compared with carriers of the minor allele C (TC + CC). In contrast, in the Mediterranean intervention group a different trend was observed although no significant differences were found between CLOCK genotypes after 12 months of treatment. Our data support the notion that a chronic consumption of a healthy diet may play a contributing role in triggering glucose metabolism by interacting with the rs1801260 SNP at CLOCK gene locus in MetS patients. Due to the complex nature of gene-environment interactions, dietary adjustment in subjects with the MetS may require a personalized approach.",2014,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

Muscle, breath, and arterial and venous blood samples were obtained at rest, during 2 h of two-legged kicking exercise at approximately 45% of kicking Vo(2peak), and during 1 h of recovery. Biopsy samples confirmed that the muscle glycogen concentration was lower in the L-CHO group versus the H-CHO group at rest, after exercise, and after recovery. The net leg protein balance was decreased in the L-CHO group compared with at rest and compared with the H-CHO condition, which was primarily due to an increase in protein degradation (area under the curve of the phenylalanine rate of appearance: 1,331 + or - 162 micromol in the L-CHO group vs. 786 + or - 51 micromol in the H-CHO group, P < 0.05) but also due to a decrease in protein synthesis late in exercise.

Whole body leucine oxidation increased above rest in the L-CHO group only and was higher than in the H-CHO group. The whole body net protein balance was reduced in the L-CHO group, largely due to a decrease in whole body protein synthesis.

The study involved 360 well adults aged 16-49 years who had no known diagnosis of chronic disease. Two annual cycles of assessment, feedback workshops, action planning, and implementation of system changes. Assessment included a structured review of health service systems and an audit of clinical records. Adherence to guideline-scheduled preventive services including taking basic measurements, laboratory investigations, lifestyle counselling and pneumococcal vaccination. Of 12 preventive services measured, delivery of four services showed improvement over the study period: counselling on diet increased from 3% to 8% (P = 0.018); counselling on physical activity from 2% to 8% (P = 0.006); counselling on smoking from 2% to 11% (P = 0.003); and counselling on alcohol from 2% to 10% (P = 0.007). There was no improvement in important measures such as monitoring of waist circumference, blood pressure and blood glucose level, and delivery of pneumococcal vaccination. Our systems-oriented intervention was associated with some improvement in counselling activities, but no significant improvement in delivery of other preventive services.

Ghrelin, polypeptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were measured in the fasting state and postprandially in 12 healthy, normal-weight volunteers (six males and six females) using a randomised crossover design. One hour after a standardised breakfast, subjects either cycled for 60 min at 65% of their maximal heart rate or rested. Subjective appetite was assessed throughout the study using visual analogue scales and subsequent EI at a buffet meal was measured at the end (3-h post-breakfast and 1-h post-exercise). Exercise significantly increased mean PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels, and this effect was maintained during the post-exercise period for GLP-1 and PP. No significant effect of exercise was observed on postprandial levels of ghrelin. During the exercise period, hunger scores were significantly decreased; however, this effect disappeared in the post-exercise period. Exercise significantly increased subsequent absolute EI, but produced a significant decrease in relative EI after accounting for the energy expended during exercise. Hunger scores and PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels showed an inverse temporal pattern during the 1-h exercise/control intervention. In conclusion, acute exercise, of moderate intensity, temporarily decreased hunger sensations and was able to produce a short-term negative energy balance. This impact on appetite and subsequent energy homeostasis was not explained by changes in postprandial levels of ghrelin; however, 'exercise-induced anorexia' may potentially be linked to increased PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels.",2007,"① 一過性の自転車運動効果"

Previous observations provide indirect evidence for an inhibitory effect of dopaminergic neurotransmission on leptin secretion. This study was done to establish the effect of bromocriptine treatment on circadian plasma leptin concentrations in obese humans. The objective of the study was to study the acute effects of bromocriptine (a D2R agonist) on circadian leptin levels in obese women, whereas body weight and caloric intake remained constant. This was a prospective, single-blind, crossover study (2004). The study was conducted at a clinical research center. Eighteen healthy obese women (body mass index 33.2 +/- 0.6 kg/m(2)) were studied twice in the early follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Treatment consisted of bromocriptine or placebo for 8 d. Blood was collected during 24 h at 20-min intervals for determination of leptin concentrations at the last day of medical treatment (bromocriptine or placebo). Mean 24-h serum concentrations were determined for insulin, glucose, free fatty acids, and triglycerides. Short-term treatment with bromocriptine reduced leptin concentration (placebo 33.6 +/- 2.5 vs. bromocriptine 30.5 +/- 2.5 ng/liter, P = 0.03). Free fatty acid concentrations were increased by treatment with bromocriptine. The increase of free fatty acids was inversely related with the decline of leptin levels. The decline of glucose, insulin, or prolactin concentrations in response to bromocriptine was not correlated with the reduction of leptin.

23074486,"","Gastric electrical stimulation: an evidence-based analysis.","The objective of this analysis was to assess the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of gastric electrical stimulation (GES) for the treatment of chronic, symptomatic refractory gastroparesis and morbid obesity. GASTROPARESIS - EPIDEMIOLOGY: Gastroparesis (GP) broadly refers to impaired gastric emptying in the absence of obstruction. Clinically, this can range from the incidental detection of delayed gastric emptying in an asymptomatic person to patients with severe nausea, vomiting and malnutrition. Symptoms of GP are nonspecific and may mimic structural disorders such as ulcer disease, partial gastric or small bowel obstruction, gastric cancer, and pancreaticobiliary disorders. Gastroparesis may occur in association with diabetes, gastric surgery (consequence of peptic ulcer surgery and vagotomy) or for unknown reasons (idiopathic gastroparesis). Symptoms include early satiety, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and weight loss. The majority of patients with GP are women. The relationship between upper gastrointestinal symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying is considered to be weak. Some patients with markedly delayed gastric emptying are asymptomatic and sometimes, severe symptoms may remit spontaneously. Idiopathic GP may represent the most common form of GP. In one tertiary referral retrospective series, the etiologies in 146 GP patients were 36% idiopathic, 29% diabetic, 13% postgastric surgery, 7.5% Parkinson's disease, 4.8% collagen vascular disorders, 4.1% intestinal pseudoobstruction and 6% miscellaneous causes. The true prevalence of digestive symptoms in patients with diabetes and the relationship of these symptoms to delayed gastric emptying are unknown. Delayed gastric emptying is present in 27% to 58% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 30% with type 2 diabetes. However, highly variable rates of gastric emptying have been reported in type 1 and 2 diabetes, suggesting that development of GP in patients with diabetes is neither universal nor inevitable. In a review of studies examining gastric emptying in patients with diabetes compared to control patients, investigators noted that in many cases the magnitude of the delay in gastric emptying is modest. GP may occur as a complication of a number of different surgical procedures. For example, vagal nerve injury may occur in 4% to 40% of patients who undergo laparoscopic fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease. The prevalence of severe, refractory GP is scantily reported in the literature. Using data from a past study, it has been estimated that the prevalence of severe, symptomatic and refractory GP in the United States population is 0.017%. Assuming an Ontario population of 13 million, this would correspond to approximately 2,000 people in Ontario having severe, symptomatic, refractory GP. The incidence of severe refractory GP estimated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is approximately 4,000 per year in the United States. This corresponds to about 150 patients in Ontario. Using expert opinion and FDA data, the incidence of severe refractory GP in Ontario is estimated to be about 20 to 150 per year. To date, there have been no long-term studies confirming the beneficial effects of maintaining euglycemia on GP symptoms. However, it has been suggested that consistent findings of physiologic studies in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients provides an argument to strive for near-normal blood glucose levels in affected diabetes patients. Dietary measures (e.g., low fibre, low fat food), prokinetic drugs (e.g., domperidone, metoclopramide and erythromycin) and antiemetic or antinausea drugs (e.g, phenothiazines, diphenhydramine) are generally effective for symptomatic relief in the majority of patients with GP. For patients with chronic, symptomatic GP who are refractory to drug treatment, surgical options may include jejunostomy tube for feeding, gastrotomy tube for stomach decompression and pyloroplasty for gastric emptying. Few small studies examined the use of botulinum toxin injections into the pyloric sphincter. However, the contribution of excessive pyloric contraction to GP has been insufficiently defined and there have been no controlled studies of this therapy. Treatment with GES is reversible and may be a less invasive option compared to stomach surgery for the treatment of patients with chronic, drug-refractory nausea and vomiting secondary to GP. In theory, GES represents an intermediate step between treatment directed at the underlying pathophysiology, and the treatment of symptoms. It is based on studies of gastric electrical patterns in GP that have identified the presence of a variety of gastric arrhythmias. Similar to a cardiac pacemaker, it was hypothesized that GES could override the abnormal rhythms, stimulate gastric emptying and eliminate symptoms. Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of at last 30 kg/m(2). Morbid obesity is defined as a BMI of at least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions. Comorbid conditions associated with obesity include diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, obstructive sleep apnea, weight-related arthropathies, and stress urinary incontinence. In the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2)) for adults aged 20 years and older has increased significantly in the population, from 2.9% (1988-1994) to 4.7% (1999-2000). An expert estimated that about 160,000 to 180,000 people are morbidly obese in Ontario. Diet, exercise, and behavioural therapy are used to help people lose weight. Bariatric surgery for morbid obesity is considered an intervention of last resort for patients who have attempted first-line forms of medical management. Gastric stimulation has been investigated for the treatment of morbid obesity; the intention being to reduce appetite and induce early satiety possibly due to inhibitory effects on gastric motility and effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and hormones related to satiety and/or appetite. Possible advantages to GES for the treatment of morbid obesity include reversibility of the procedure, less invasiveness than some bariatric procedures, e.g., gastric bypass, and less side effects (e.g., dumping syndrome). Electrical stimulation is delivered via an implanted system that consists of a neurostimulator and 2 leads. The surgical procedure can be performed via either an open or laparoscopic approach. An external programmer used by the physician can deliver instructions to the GES, i.e., adjust the rate and amplitude of stimulation (Figure 1). GES may be turned off by the physician at any time or may be removed. The battery life is approximately 4-5 years For treatment of GP, the GES leads are secured in the muscle of the lower stomach, 10 cm proximal to the pylorus (the opening from the stomach to the intestine), 1 cm apart and connected to an implantable battery-powered neurostimulator which is placed in a small pocket in the abdominal wall For treatment of morbid obesity, GES leads are implanted along the lesser curvature of the stomach where the vagal nerve branches spread, approximately 8 cm proximal to the pylorus. However, the implant positioning of the leads has been variably reported in the literature. The Enterra Therapy System and the Transcend II Implantable Gastric Stimulation System (Medtronic Inc.) are both licensed as class 3 devices by Health Canada (license numbers 60264 and 66948 respectively). The Health Canada indications for use are: ENTERRA THERAPY SYSTEM: ""For use in the treatment of chronic intractable (drug-refractory) nausea and vomiting."" ""For use in weight reduction for obese adults with a body mass index greater than 35.""The GES device that is licensed by Health Canada for treatment of GP, produces high-frequency GES. Most clinical studies examining GES for GP have used high-frequency (4 times the intrinsic slow wave frequency, i.e., 12 cycles per minute), low energy, short duration pulses. This type of stimulation does not alter gastric muscular contraction and has no effect on slow wave dysrhythmias. The mechanism of action is unclear but it is hypothesized that high-frequency GES may act on sensory fibers directed to the CNS. The GES device licensed by Health Canada for treatment of morbid obesity produces low-frequency GES, which is close to or just above the normal/native gastric slow wave cycle (approximately 3 cycles/min.). This pacing uses low-frequency, high-energy, long-duration pulses to induce propagated slow waves that replace the spontaneous ones. Low-frequency pacing does not invoke muscular contractions. Most studies examining the use of GES for the treatment of morbid obesity use low-frequency GES. Under normal circumstances, the gastric slow wave propagates distally and determines the frequency and propagation direction of gastric peristalsis. Low-frequency GES aims to produce abnormal gastric slow waves that can induce gastric dysrhythmia, disrupt regular propagation of slow waves, cause hypomotility of the stomach, delay gastric emptying, reduce food intake, prolong satiety, and produce weight loss. In the United States, the Enterra Therapy System is a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD), meaning it is a medical device designated by the FDA for use in the treatment of medical conditions that affect fewer than 4,000 individuals per year. The Enterra Therapy System is indicated for ""the treatment of chronic, drug- refractory nausea and vomiting secondary to GP of diabetes or idiopathic etiology"" (not postsurgical etiologies). GES for morbid obesity has not been approved by the FDA and is for investigational use only in the United States. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",2006,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

Estrogen and progesterone have potent effects on substrate use during exercise in women, but the role of testosterone (T) in mediating substrate use is unknown. The purpose of this investigation was to assess how large variations in the concentration of blood T would impact substrate use during exercise in men. Nine healthy, active men were studied in three distinct hormonal conditions: physiological T (no intervention), low T (pharmacological suppression of endogenous T with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist), and high T (supplementation with transdermal T). Total carbohydrate oxidation, blood glucose rate of disappearance, and estimated muscle glycogen use were assessed by using stable isotope dilution and indirect calorimetry at rest and while bicycling at approximately 60% of peak O2 consumption for 90 min. Relative to the physiological condition (T = 5.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml), total plasma T was considerably suppressed in low T (0.8 +/- 0.1) and elevated in high T (10.9 +/- 1.1). Despite the large changes in plasma T, carbohydrate oxidation, glucose rate of disappearance, and estimated muscle glycogen use were very similar across the three conditions. There were also no differences in plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, lactate, or free fatty acids. Plasma estradiol (E) concentrations were elevated in high T, but correlations between substrate use and plasma concentrations of T, E, or the T-to-E ratio were very weak (r2 < 0.20). In conclusion, unlike the effect of acute elevation in E to constrain carbohydrate use in women, acute changes in circulating T concentrations do not appear to alter substrate use during exercise in men.",2005,"① 一過性の自転車運動効果"

After 1 week, isolated Langendorff-perfused hearts were subjected to 30 min occlusion of LAD coronary artery without or with preceding preconditioning induced by one cycle of 5 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion. Glycogen and lactate contents were estimated in the preconditioned and non-preconditioned hearts before and after ischemia. Diabetic hearts were more resistant to ischemia-induced arrhythmias: incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) decreased to 42% and only transient ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred in 17% of the hearts as compared to the non-diabetic controls (VT 100% and VF 70% including sustained VF 36%; p < 0.05). Preconditioning effectively suppressed the incidence and severity of arrhythmias (VT 33%, VF 0%) in the normal hearts. However, this intervention did not confer any additional protection in the diabetic hearts. Despite higher glycogen content in the diabetic myocardium and greater glycogenolysis during ischemia, production of lactate in these hearts was significantly lower than in the controls. Preconditioning caused a substantial decrease in the accumulation of lactate in the normal hearts, whereby in the diabetic hearts, this intervention did not cause any further reduction in the level of lactate. In conclusion, diabetic rat hearts exhibit lower susceptibility to ischemic injury and show no additional response to preconditioning. Reduced production of glycolytic metabolites during ischemia can account for the enhanced resistance of diabetic hearts to ischemia as well as for the lack of further protection by preconditioning.",2000,"① 一過性の自転車運動効果"

A consensus panel of general practitioners and diabetes specialists established guidelines based on the French St. Vincent recommendations. An audit involving 73 volunteer general practitioners (out of 965 in the Essonne) then evaluated compliance with these guidelines. Care and outcome were assessed in 505 (1995) and 604 (1996) Type 2 diabetic patients. The first audit cycle showed that defined standards were not met for several criteria and also revealed a lack of standardisation of HbA1c measurements and delayed intervention when blood glucose control was inadequate. Corrective measures were adopted: cooperative protocols for foot care, prevention of nephropathy and retinopathy, standardisation of HbA1c, and an educational programme at the primary health care level. The second audit cycle showed improvement in foot care (+33.6%), quality (+39.9%), prescription of HbA1c (+11.9%), and control of blood pressure (+11.9%) and blood lipids (+12.8%). The proportion of early interventions in case of inadequate glucose control increased significantly (+10.5%). However, some gaps persisted, mainly regarding screening for complications, diet counselling and patient education. This study shows that cooperation between general practitioners and diabetes specialists is feasible and effective in the context of a district-wide approach, and that it facilitates the adoption of international guidelines by local physicians. A project has been developed to provide structured diabetes care in general practice and better access to specialist services in order to improve the outcome of Type 2 diabetic patients.",1999,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"

SESIGN: Performance testing and nutrition assessment were completed on hemodialysis patients who participated in an in-center, intradialytic exercise program. Data were collected at initiation and after 3, 6, and 12 months of participation. One-tailed, paired t-test was used for statistical assessment. Free-standing, outpatient dialysis center with an average of 130 patients on staff-assisted hemodialysis. Data were collected on 16 patients who completed 3 months in the program, 6 patients who completed 6 months in the program, and 4 patients who completed 12 months in the program. Patients participated in a progressive, self-paced exercise program including cycling before or during hemodialysis, or walking on a treadmill before hemodialysis. In addition to this, patients also had the option of doing stretching and/or light weight exercises during hemodialysis. Performance tests included 60-second sit-stand, 28-ft slow and brisk walk, 60-second stair climb, and 60-second leg lifts. Nutrition assessment included changes in estimated dry weight, hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum glucose, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, Kt/V, normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), average monthly interdialytic weight gain, and monthly mean predialysis and postdialysis blood pressure. Glycohemoglobin was assessed in diabetic patients. Patients' charts were reviewed for episodes of intradialytic cramping and hypotension. All patients showed improvement in measures of physical performance at 3, 6, and 12 months. Mean phosphorus decreased from 1.94 +/- 0.45 mmol (6.02 +/- 1.4 mg/dL) by 11% at 3 months (P = 0.05) and by 26% at 12 months (P < 0.02). Patients who exercised for 12 months experienced a mean 16% reduction in blood glucose. Mean glucose levels for 7 diabetic patients decreased from 12.35 +/- 5.8 mmol/L (224.1 +/- 105) to 11. 66 +/- 1.9 mmol/L (211.7 +/- 34 mg/dL); however, this was not statistically significant. Mean glycohemoglobin levels for diabetic patients did not change significantly. Increases were seen in Kt/V, estimated dry weight, and serum albumin; however, these were not statistically significant. Decreases were noted in mean predialysis and postdialysis blood pressures and average interdialytic weight gains at 3, 6, and 12 months. A formal intradialytic exercise regimen can produce objective evidence of improvement in physical performance and some measures of nutritional well-being over 3 to 12 months. Further research is needed to determine if these changes are a result of exercise alone or increased compliance with the medical and dietary regimen.",1999,"⑤ 介入方法が複数"
