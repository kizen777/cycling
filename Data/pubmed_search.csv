However, due to the exercise intensity causing high-perceived exertion, the participants often do not wish to continue the training. The 10-20-30 training concept consists of low intensity for 30 s, 20 s at a moderate pace, and then 10 s with high intensity either running or cycling. A 10-20-30 training session consist of two to four 5-min blocks. The 10-20-30 training improved fitness and performance as well as lowered blood pressure and body fat of both untrained and trained individuals even with a significant reduction in the training volume. Similarly, hypertensive, diabetic, and asthmatic patients lowered body fat, improved fitness, and performance during a 10-20-30-training intervention period. In addition, hypertensive patients reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure markedly with the 10-20-30 training twice a week for 8 weeks. Diabetic patients lowered long-term blood sugar (HbA1c), which did not occur with moderate-intensity exercise training. Furthermore, asthmatic patients improved their control of asthma and asthma-related quality of life with the 10-20-30 training. The adherence for the patient groups was high (>80%), and no adverse events were reported. Thus, the 10-20-30 training seems to be time efficient and feasible for untrained and trained individuals as well as patients and may be used in the prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases.","2024"

Based on the median of FBG (4.97 mmol/L, 1 mmol/L = 18 mg/dL), the subjects were categorized into the low-normal group (3.90 ≤ FBG ≤ 4.97 mmol/L, n = 472) and the high-normal group (4.97 < FBG < 6.10 mmol/L, n = 472). Multivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were used to analyze the relationship between high-normal FBG and ART outcomes. live birth rate (LBR). LBR was significantly lower in the high-normal group than in the low-normal group (36.8% vs. 45.1%, p = 0.010), and the miscarriage rate was considerably higher than that in the low-normal group (23.9% vs. 16.5%, p = 0.041). High-normal FBG of female was an independent predictor of live birth (adjusted OR:0.747, 95% CI: 0.541-0.963, p = 0.027) and miscarriage (adjusted OR:1.610, 95% CI: 1.018-2.547, p = 0.042). ROC analyses showed that the cut-off values of FBG (endpoints: live birth and miscarriage) were 5.07 mmol/L, and 5.01 mmol/L, respectively. In women with normal BMI, high-normal FBG is an independent risk factor for lower LBR and higher miscarriage rate in single blastocyst FET cycles. Attention to preconception FBG monitoring in this particular population may allow early intervention to improve ART outcomes.","2024"

Misalignment between circadian timing system and daily rhythms of food intake adversely impacts metabolic regulatory mechanisms and cardiovascular function. Restricting the daily EW by imposing an eating-fasting cycle through time-restricted eating (TRE) can restore robust circadian rhythms, support cellular metabolism, and improve cardiometabolic health. The aim of this study was to assess a feasibility of 12-week TRE intervention with self-selected 10 h EW and effects of TRE on EW duration, cardiometabolic outcomes, daily rhythms of behavior, and wellbeing in Polish patients with MetS and EW ≥ 14 h/day. Dietary intake was monitored with a validated myCircadianClock application (mCC app). Adherence to TRE defined as the proportion of days recorded with mCC app in which participants satisfied 10-h TRE was the primary outcome. A total of 26 patients (aged 45 ± 13 years, 62% women, 3.3 ± 0.5 MetS criteria, EW 14 ± 1.5 h/day) were enrolled. Coexistence of increased waist circumference (WC) (96% of patients), elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (77%), and elevated blood pressure (BP) (69%) was the most common MetS pattern (50%). TRE intervention (mean duration of 81.6 ± 12.6 days) led to reducing daily EW by 28% (p < 0.0001). Adherence to TRE was 87 ± 13%. Adherence to logging food intake on mCC app during TRE was 70 ± 27%. Post TRE, a decrease in body weight (2%, 1.7 ± 3.6 kg, p = 0.026), body mass index (BMI) (1%, 0.5 ± 1.2 kg/m2, p = 0.027), WC (2%, 2.5 ± 3.9 cm, p = 0.003), systolic BP (4%, 4.8 ± 9.0 mmHg, p = 0.012), FPG (4%, 3.8 ± 6.9 mg/dL, p = 0.037), glycated hemoglobin (4%, 0.2 ± 0.4%, p = 0.011), mean fasting glucose level from continuous glucose monitor (CGM) (4%, 4.0 ± 6.1 mg/dL, p = 0.002), and sleepiness score (25%, 1.9 ± 3.2 points, p = 0043) were observed. A significant decrease in body weight (2%), BMI (2%), WC (3%), mean CGM fasting glucose (6%), sleepiness score (27%), and depression score (60%) was found in patients with mean post-TRE EW ≤ 10 h/day (58% of total), and not in patients with EW > 10 h/day. Adherence to TRE was higher in patients with post-TRE EW ≤ 10 h/day vs. patients with EW > 10 h/day (94 ± 6% vs. 77 ± 14%, p = 0.003). Our findings indicate that 10-h TRE was feasible in the European MetS population. TRE resulted in reducing daily EW and improved cardiometabolic outcomes and wellbeing in patients with MetS and prolonged EW. Use of the mCC app can aid in implementing TRE. This pilot clinical trial provides exploratory data that are a basis for a large-scale randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy and sustainability of TRE for reducing cardiometabolic risks in MetS populations. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms of TRE effects, including its impact on circadian rhythm disruption.","2024"

To adapt to this energy intake pattern, organisms have developed a 24-hour rhythmic diurnal cycle over long periods, known as the circadian rhythm, or biological clock. With the gradual advancement of research on the biological clock, it has become increasingly evident that disruptions in the circadian rhythm are closely associated with the occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To further understand the progress of research on T2D and the biological clock, this paper reviews the correlation between the biological clock and glucose metabolism and analyzes its potential mechanisms. Based on this, we discuss the potential factors contributing to circadian rhythm disruption and their impact on the risk of developing T2D, aiming to explore new possible intervention measures for the prevention and treatment of T2D in the future. Under the light-dark circadian rhythm, in order to adapt to this change, the human body forms an internal biological clock involving a variety of genes, proteins and other molecules. The main mechanism is the transcription-translation feedback loop centered on the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer. The expression of important circadian clock genes that constitute this loop can regulate T2DM-related blood glucose traits such as glucose uptake, fat metabolism, insulin secretion/glucagon secretion and sensitivity in various peripheral tissues and organs. In addition, sleep, light, and dietary factors under circadian rhythms also affect the occurrence of T2DM.","2024"

However, new primary studies on the topic have recently been published, and the respective meta-analytic evidence needs to be updated. To systematically review, summarise and appraise evidence on physical health benefits of participation in different recreational sports. Searches for journal articles were conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, SpoLit, SPORTDiscus, Sports Medicine & Education Index and Web of Science. We included longitudinal and intervention studies investigating physical health outcomes associated with participation in a given sport among generally healthy adults without disability. A total of 136 papers from 76 studies conducted among 2.6 million participants were included in the review. Our meta-analyses of available evidence found that: (1) cycling reduces the risk of coronary heart disease by 16% (pooled hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80, 0.89), all-cause mortality by 21% (HR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.84), cancer mortality by 10% (HR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.96) and cardiovascular mortality by 20% (HR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.86); (2) football has favourable effects on body composition, blood lipids, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, cardiovascular function at rest, cardiorespiratory fitness and bone strength (p < 0.050); (3) handball has favourable effects on body composition and cardiorespiratory fitness (p < 0.050); (4) running reduces the risk of all-cause mortality by 23% (HR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.85), cancer mortality by 20% (HR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.89) and cardiovascular mortality by 27% (HR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.94) and improves body composition, cardiovascular function at rest and cardiorespiratory fitness (p < 0.010); and (5) swimming reduces the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.92) and improves body composition and blood lipids (p < 0.010).

Sixteen participants conducted three aerobic exercise sessions (maximum 75 min) in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. Thirty minutes before exercise, participants ingested a drink containing either 250 mg of caffeine + 10 g of glucose + aspartame (CAF), 10 g of glucose + aspartame (GLU), or aspartame alone (ASP). The primary outcome was time to hypoglycaemia. There was a significant effect of the condition on time to hypoglycaemia (χ2 = 7.674, p = .0216). Pairwise comparisons revealed an 85.7% risk reduction of hypoglycaemia for CAF compared with ASP (p = .044). No difference was observed between GLU and ASP (p = .104) or between CAF and GLU (p = .77). While CAF increased glucose levels during exercise compared with GLU and ASP (8.3 ± 1.9 mmol/L vs. 7.7 ± 2.2 mmol/L vs. 5.8 ± 1.4 mmol/L; p < .001), peak plasma glucose levels during exercise did not differ between CAF and GLU (9.3 ± 1.4 mmol/L and 9.1 ± 1.6 mmol/L, p = .80), but were higher than in ASP (6.6 ± 1.1 mmol/L; p < .001). The difference in glucose levels between CAF and GLU was largest during the last 15 min of exercise (p = .002). Compared with GLU, CAF lowered perceived exertion (p = .023). Pre-exercise caffeine ingestion combined with a low dose of glucose reduced exercise-related hypoglycaemia compared with control while avoiding hyperglycaemia.","2024"

Methods: A mouse model of PCOS was established by administering dehydroepiandrosterone in combination with high fat diet, and the mouse model was given a berberine treatment. The study consisted of a blank control group (C group), a PCOS model group (M group) and a berberine treatment group (T group). During the experiment, the mice were closely monitored through timed body weight measurements and estrous cycle monitoring; intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test were done. Upon completion of the pharmacological intervention, the wet weights of liver, ovary and fat deposits of mice were assessed and subjected to HE staining to confirm the success of PCOS modeling and the efficacy of berberine. Additionally, fecal samples were analyzed for intestinal flora through 16S rRNA analysis. Results: The PCOS model was established successfully, berberine alleviated the disturbance of estrous cycle in mice, and significantly alleviated fat accumulation and metabolic abnormalities of glucose in mice. The cross-sectional area of fat pad cells in T group was (2 858±146) μm², which was significantly lower than that in M group [(9 518±347) μm²], and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). The blood glucose levels in T group were significantly lower than those in M group (P<0.05). The composition and structure of intestinal flora in mice of M group with PCOS (compared with C group) and in mice of T group after berberine intervention (compared with M group) were significantly altered. However, alpha diversity did not change significantly among three groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: Berberine could alleviate PCOS by intervening in the alterations of gut microbiota.","2024"

Sprague-Dawley rats with normal glucose levels were randomly divided into three groups, including a conventional diet control group (Group A), high-fat-high-sugar diet model group (Group B), and DGR group (Group C, high-fat-high-sugar diet containing 20.5 g DGR). After 10 weeks of intervention, the fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2 h blood glucose [PBG; using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)], hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), plasma total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG) were tested, and the livers of rats were removed to calculate the liver index. Then, hepatic portal TG were tested using the Gross permanent optimization-participatiory action planning enzymatic method and phosphoproteomics was performed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis followed by database search and bioinformatics analysis. Finally, cell experiments were used to verify the results of phosphoproteomics. Phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4k4) and phosphorylated adducin 1 (ADD1) were detected using western blotting. DGR effectively reduced PBG, TG, and the liver index (P < 0.05), and significantly decreased HbA1c, TC, and hepatic portal TG (P < 0.01), showed significant hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, red oil O staining, and Masson staining of liver tissue. The total spectrum was 805 334, matched spectrum was 260 471, accounting for accounting 32.3%, peptides were 19 995, modified peptides were 14 671, identified proteins were 4601, quantifiable proteins were 4417, identified sites were 15 749, and quantified sites were 14659. Based on the threshold of expression fold change ( > 1.2), DGR up-regulated the modification of 228 phosphorylation sites involving 204 corresponding function proteins, and down-regulated the modification of 358 phosphorylation sites involving 358 corresponding function proteins, which included correcting 75 phosphorylation sites involving 64 corresponding function proteins relating to glycolipid metabolism. Therefore, DGR improved biological tissue processes, including information storage and processing, cellular processes and signaling, and metabolism. The metabolic functions regulated by DGR mainly include energy production and conversion, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, lipid transport and metabolism, inorganic ion transport and metabolism, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism. In vitro phosphorylation validation based on cell experiments showed that the change trends in the phosphorylation level of MAP4k4 and ADD1 were consistent with that of previous phosphoproteomics studies. DGR extensively corrects the modification of phosphorylation sites to improve corresponding glycolipid metabolism-related protein expression in rats with glycolipid metabolism disorders, thereby regulating glycolipid metabolism through a multi-target and multi-method process.","2024"

SJL leads to chronic circadian rhythm disruption and may affect nearly 70% of the general population, leading to increased risk for cardiometabolic diseases. This study investigated the effects of SJL on metabolic health, exercise performance, and exercise-induced skeletal muscle adaptations in mice. Ten-week-old C57BL/6J mice (n = 40) were allocated to four groups: control sedentary (CON-SED), control exercise (CON-EX), social jet lag sedentary (SJL-SED), and social jet lag exercise (SJL-EX). CON mice were housed under a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. SJL was simulated by implementing a 4-h phase delay for 3 days to simulate ""weekends,"" followed by a 4-h phase advance back to ""weekdays,"" for 6 wk. EX mice had free access to a running wheel. Graded exercise tests (GXTs) and glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) were performed at baseline and after intervention to monitor the effects of exercise and social jet lag on cardiorespiratory and metabolic health, respectively. SJL led to alterations in activity and running patterns and clock gene expression in skeletal muscle and decreased average running distance (P < 0.05). SJL-SED mice gained significantly more weight compared with CON-SED and SJL-EX mice (P < 0.01). SJL impaired fasting blood glucose and glucose tolerance compared with CON mice (P < 0.05), which was partially restored by exercise in SJL-EX mice. SJL also blunted improvements in exercise performance and mitochondrial content in the quadriceps. These data suggest that SJL blunted some cardiometabolic adaptations to exercise and that proper circadian hygiene is necessary for maintaining health and performance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In mice, disrupting circadian rhythms with social jet lag for 6 wk caused significant weight gain, higher fasting blood glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance compared with control. Voluntary exercise in mice experiencing social jet lag prevented weight gain, though the mice still experienced increased fasting blood glucose and impaired exercise performance compared with trained mice not experiencing social jet lag. Social jet lag seems to be a potent circadian rhythm disruptor that impacts exercise-induced training adaptations.","2024"

FDX1 is a ferredoxin-reducing protein on human mitochondria that plays an important role in steroid anabolism. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for PCOS. Recent studies have suggested that FDX1 may be associated with the development of PCOS. This study aims to explore the pivotal role of FDX1 in the amelioration of PCOS through liraglutide intervention. A PCOS rat model was induced via subcutaneous DHEA injections. Following successful model establishment, the rats were treated with liraglutide combined with metformin, or with each drug individually, over a six-week period. After 6 weeks of treatment, we assessed changes in body weight, fasting blood glucose, sex hormone levels, estrous cycle regularity, ovarian morphology, FDX1 expression in ovarian tissue, and ovarian ROS levels. PCOS rats exhibited significant increases in body weight and fasting blood glucose levels, disrupted estrous cycles, and polycystic ovarian morphology. FDX1 expression was notably reduced in the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. Treatment with liraglutide, both alone and in combination with metformin, led to improvements in body weight, fasting blood glucose, sex hormone balance, estrous cycle regularity, ovarian morphology, and ovarian ROS levels. Notably, FDX1 expression was significantly restored in all treatment groups, with the most substantial increase observed in the liraglutide-treated group. This study suggests that FDX1 could serve as a potential biomarker for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of liraglutide's therapeutic effects in PCOS management.","2024"

Although the advantages of proper glycaemic control in hospitalised patients with diabetes are well established, a variety of barriers limit accomplishment of blood glucose targets. Our primary aim was to decrease the number of glucose values above 180 mg/dL in non-critical care hospitalised patients using an audit and feedback intervention with pharmacy and internal medicine residents. A resident-led multidisciplinary team implemented the quality improvement (QI) project including conception, literature review, educating residents, iterative development of audit and feedback tools and data analysis. The multidisciplinary team met every 5 weeks and undertook three 'plan-do-study-act' cycles over an 8-month intervention period (August 2022 to March 2023) to educate residents on inpatient hyperglycaemia management, develop and implement an audit and feedback process and assess areas for improvement. We performed 1045 audits analysing 16 095 accu-checks on 395 non-duplicated patients. Most audits showed compliance with guidelines. The monthly run-on chart shows per cent of glucose values above 180 mg/dL in our non-ICU hospitalised patients and an overall pre-to-post comparison of 25.1%-23.0% (p value<0.05). The intervention was well accepted by residents evidenced by survey results. We did not meet our primary aim to reduce hyperglycaemia by 30% and this combined with the audits showing mostly compliance with guidelines suggests that prescribing behaviour was not a key driver of inpatient hyperglycaemia in our population. This internal medicine resident and pharmacy interprofessional collaboration with audit and feedback for inpatient hyperglycaemia was feasible, well accepted and had a statistically significant yet small improvement in inpatient hyperglycaemia. The project may be helpful to others wishing to explore inpatient hyperglycaemia, interprofessional QI with pharmacists, resident-led QI and audit and feedback.","2024"

With supervision, the EXP group performed one bout of 30-s sprint-cycle daily, Mondays to Fridays over 6 weeks, while CON group continued with their usual lifestyle. The followings were measured at pre- and post-intervention: maximal aerobic power, peak torque of knee extensors and flexors at velocities 30° s-1 and 300° s-1, resting heart rate, resting blood pressure, body fat percentage, fasting lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, and fasting insulin levels. There were no significant improvements in the EXP group for all the measured variables (all P > 0.05); except for significant interaction effects in peak torque of knee extensors at 30° s-1 (P = 0.044) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P = 0.046). Post hoc test indicate that CON group showed decline in their low-density lipo-proteins levels (P = 0.024). Six weeks of one all-out bout of 30-s sprint-cycle per day, for 5 consecutive days per week, was ineffective in improving cardiovascular fitness, maximal strength, and most health markers in physically active young adults. The present results when combined with the previous literature suggest that there is a possibility of a minimum threshold for a number of sprint-cycle bouts needed to be performed before any form of cardio-metabolic-health benefit is accrued.","2024"

The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of melatonin in alleviating PCOS-induced alterations in female Wistar rats. PCOS was induced in female albino rats by administering letrozole at a dose of 1 mg/kg for 21 days. A total of 24 rats were randomly selected and divided into four groups: group I (normal control), group II (melatonin treatment), group III (letrozole treatment), and group IV (melatonin therapy for PCOS rats). Physical parameters (body and uterus weight), hormone profile (LH and FSH), and steroidogenic enzyme activities and an oral glucose test were assessed using standard methods. Histological analysis was performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The results demonstrated that exogenous melatonin administration significantly improved PCOS symptoms in rats, including reduced body weight gain, changes in organ weight/body weight index, blood glucose level, percentage diestrus phase, testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and LH/FSH ratio, as well as 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD enzyme activity. Histopathological findings revealed well-developed follicles, decreased cystic follicles, and increased antral follicles, Graafian follicles, and corpus luteum in PCOS rats treated with melatonin.

This disease involves different organ systems and presents with a variety of clinical manifestations. Most patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced type 1 diabetes are reported to have no combination of autoimmune disease. We report a case of Sintilimab-related diabetes mellitus and psoriasis. We report a case of a 65-year-old female with Sintilimab-related diabetes mellitus and psoriasis. The patient treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (Sintilimab) for 4 cycles. The patient presented with inexplicable bouts of nausea and vomiting, accompanied by chest discomfort and a feeling of breathlessness, prompting their admission to the local hospital. The initial assessment upon admission revealed an abrupt elevation in blood glucose levels, alongside normal ketone levels, lactic acidosis, and hyperuricemia. A comprehensive regimen was provided to regulate glucose levels and address the symptoms, resulting in notable improvement and subsequent discharge. Regrettably, the patient's personal decision to discontinue medication for a single day led to the emergence of acute ketoacidosis, coupled with a recurrence of psoriasis vulgaris. Consequently, readmission became necessary. Based on the patient's medical history and diabetes antibody testing, the diagnosis of immune checkpoint inhibitor induced diabetes mellitus has been confidently established. The patient ceased treatment with Sintilimab and was initiated on insulin therapy for glycemic control, alongside symptomatic management for psoriasis. Upon stabilization of the condition, long-term administration of exogenous insulin was implemented as a substitute treatment. Outside of the hospital, insulin therapy effectively maintained stable blood glucose levels, and there were no further episodes of psoriasis flare-ups. The clinical manifestations of immune checkpoint inhibitor induced diabetes mellitus are variable, and in this case the patient presented with unique primary symptoms. Therefore, it is crucial to accumulate relevant cases, understand the different clinical presentations and identify the underlying mechanisms of the disease. This will provide further evidence for early therapeutic intervention in similar patients in the future.","2023"

According to blood glucose level,28 diabetic rats were selected and continued to be fed with high glucose and high fat diet, were stratified by body weight, and divided randomly by blood glucose into Model group (was given sterile water by gastric perfusion and injected aquae pro injection intraperitoneally), Dangua group [Dangua liquor 20.5 g·kg-1·d-1 by perfusion and aquae pro injection intraperitoneally], Inhibitor group [sterile water by perfusion and nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (Nampt) specific blocker GEN-617 1.25 mg/kg intraperitoneally], DanInhit group (Dangua liquor and GEN-617 synchronously). Control group were continuously fed with ordinary diet. The intervention was last for 10 weeks. Body weight (BW), liver index (LI), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), TC, TG, free fatty acids (FFA), creatinine (Cr), and A-ketoglutarate (α-KG), Iso-citric acid (ICA), oxaloacetic acid (OAA) were tested. The cytochrome C oxidase (COX) and Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were evaluated by Colorimetry; Nampt protein, Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase (ATPs), Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)and its reduced (NADH) in liver were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The expressions of Nampt and mitochondrialnadhdehydrogenase-1 (mt-ND1) gene in liver was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Hepatic tissue staining was also completed. The levels of BW, ICA, α-KG and Nampt-mRNA in the Model group are lower than that in the Normal group (P < 0.05), conversely, liver weight, LI, TC, HbA1c, SDH and ATPs, mt-ND1-mRNA, and Nampt protein in the Model group are higher (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Compared with Model group, the levels of ICA, Nampt-mRNA and Nampt in Dangua group are significantly increased, and FFA obviously raised (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05); liver weight, BW, SDH are obviously lower, and HbA1c decreased significantly (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). TG, FFA and Nampt protein increased in the DanInhit group, TC, TG, BW obviously increased in the Inhibitor group, but SDH is decreased in both the two groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared with Dangua group, DanInhib group has the lower levels of ICA, mt-ND1-mRNA, Nampt-mRNA, and the higher level of BW, LI and HbA1c.

Astragalus polysaccharide (APS)-as a water-soluble heteropolysaccharide-can lower blood sugar and lipid and exert anti-aging effects and thus has been proven to be beneficial to various types of metabolic diseases. However, specific mechanisms of the action of APS on PCOS are yet to be studied. Herein, BALB/C female mice aged 3 weeks were randomly divided into three groups (10 mice/group): oil + PBS group, DHEA + PBS group, and DHEA + APS group. Changes in the estrous cycle, ovarian tissue sections, serum levels of the hormone, blood glucose, blood lipid, and OS were studied. The intestinal microbiome was sequenced and Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between serum metabolic indexes and microflora. The results revealed that APS treatment ameliorated insulin resistance, OS, and dyslipidemia in PCOS mice. The results of 16S rDNA sequencing indicated that there were significant differences in the composition and diversity of intestinal microorganisms between DHEA and APS treatments. Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, Bacilli, Lactobacillaceae, and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A13_group were abundant in the oil + PBS group. Bacteroidota and Muribaculaceae were enriched in the DHEA + PBS group, while Rikenellaceae, Odoribacter, and Marinifilaceae were enriched in the DHEA + APS group. Furthermore, Spearman correlation analysis showed that there were close interactions and correlations between intestinal bacteria and indicators of blood glucose, blood lipids, steroid hormones, and OS in PCOS mice. Overall, the study showed that APS improved PCOS in mice by correcting serum metabolic disorders and increasing microbiome diversity, which may provide insight into understanding the pathogenesis and be a beneficial intervention for PCOS.","2024"

In the final linagliptin QSP model, the complicated disposition of linagliptin was characterized by a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic (PK) model with an enterohepatic cycling (EHC) component as well as target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) processes occurring in both tissues and plasma, and the inhibitory effect of linagliptin on DPP-4 was determined by the linagliptin-DPP-4 complex in the central compartment based on target occupancy principle. The integrated GIP-GLP1-glucagon-glucose-insulin system contains five indirect response models as the ""skeleton"" structure with 12 feedback loops incorporated within the glucose control system. Our model adequately characterized the substantial nonlinear PK of linagliptin, time course of DPP-4 inhibition, as well as the kinetics of GIP, GLP-1, glucagon, and glucose simultaneously in humans. Our model provided valuable insights on linagliptin pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and complicated glucose homeostasis. Since the glucose regulation modeling framework within the QSP model is ""drug-independent"", our model can be easily adopted by others to evaluate the effect of other DPP-4 inhibitors on the glucose control system. In addition, our QSP model, which contains more components than other reported glucose regulation models, can potentially be used to evaluate the effect of combination antidiabetic therapy targeting different components of glucose control system.","2024"

This study aims to probe the effects and mechanisms of GFW combined with rosiglitazone on PCOS via PI3K/AKT/NF-κB and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways. A rat PCOS model established by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) injection. The experiment was allocated to control, DHEA, GFW, rosiglitazone, GFW + rosiglitazone groups. Treatment for 30 days, we monitored weight and ovarian weight of rats. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid metabolism indexes, estrous cycle and sex hormone-, inflammation-, oxidative stress-related factors were examined. Hematoxylin&eosin staining assessed ovarian tissue pathological changes. Western blot determined PI3K/AKT/NF-κB, Nrf2/HO-1 pathways-related markers. GFW and rosiglitazone treatment suppressed body weight and ovarian weight in PCOS rats. They also decreased FBG, FINS, HOMA-IR while inhibited total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and enhanced high-density lipoprotein (HDL). They ameliorated estrous cycle, ovarian histological changes and follicular development. They restrained testosterone (T), luteinizing hormone (LH) and accelerated estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). They inhibited glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) in serum while increased GSH-Px, SOD and decrease MDA in ovarian tissues. They reduced C-reactive protein, interleukin-18 (IL-18), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-6, IL-1β levels. GFW and rosiglitazone co-intervention regulated PI3K/AKT/NF-κB and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways in PCOS rats.

To evaluate the effect of maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy on the glycolipid metabolism of offspring at different life-cycles (from birth to adulthood) and to explore the improvement of different dosages of vitamin D supplementation. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed vitamin D-deprived (VDD group) or standard vitamin D diets (SC group) during pregnancy, and their diets were changed to standard vitamin D diets during lactation (the offspring were sorted into VDDoffspring and SCoffspring groups). After weaning, rats in the VDDoffspring group were randomly assigned to the VDDoffspring, VDDoffspring-S3300 and VDDoffspring-S10000 groups with diets containing standard, medium and high dosages of vitamin D for 12 wk. Serum was collected for biochemical analyses at postnatal Day 21, postnatal Day 56 and postnatal Day 84. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at postnatal Day 70. Compared to SCoffspring, rats in the VDDoffspring group had significantly lower birth weight with faster weight gain and higher levels of lipid metabolism in early life. After near adulthood, the differences in weight and lipid metabolism between the two groups disappeared. OGTT showed significantly higher blood glucose levels in the VDDoffspring group at 30 min, 60 min, and 90 min. The continuation of vitamin D supplementation at medium and high dosages after weaning did not cause any obvious changes in weight or glycolipid metabolism (except for postprandial hyperglycemia). OGTT demonstrated that the glucose levels in the VDDoffspring-S3300 group were lowest at all the time points and that those in the VDDoffspring-S10000 group were the highest at 30 min, 60 min, and 90 min among the three groups. The adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy on glycolipid metabolism in offspring vary in different stages. Over a long time period, adequate vitamin D supplementation is beneficial to glycolipid metabolism for the offspring of subjects with vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy; however, further improvement is required.","2023"

Moreover, pregnant women with GDM, multiple pregnancies or who were overweight were more likely to have FPG decline from vitamin D treatment. Vitamin D supplementation significantly protected glucose homeostasis in mid-late gestation, and glycemic response to vitamin D may be dependent on basal 25(OH)D status, VDR gene polymorphism or their metabolic profiles.

Participatory action research with pre-post intervention. A two-run cycle of action and spirals from participatory action research was undertaken using a purposive sampling method to involve healthcare professionals and diabetic patients from September 2021 to June 2022. The nurse-led shared decision-making model of care was designed and implemented congruent with participatory action research principles. Quantitative measures were collected about patients' perceived involvement in shared decision-making and their understanding of the risks and benefits of using complementary and alternative medicine. Patients' outcomes of disease control (fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c) were also collected. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS software (version 28). Interviews were summarized using thematic analysis. An EQUATOR Network guideline for participatory action research supported the preparation of this paper. Comparison of pre-post intervention outcomes showed that patients' scale scores on shared decision-making involvement and understanding of the risk-benefit of using complementary and alternative medicine improved significantly after implementing the model. Fasting plasma glucose improved only slightly after a 3-month follow-up. The care model strengthens patient involvement in their disease management and makes appropriate decisions about CAM use that should reduce potentially harmful side effects or interactions between CAM and conventional medicine. The shared decision-making model of care incorporates evidence-based CAM research into practice, facilitates the standardization of CAM management in diabetes, improves care options for patients and educates nurses about CAM use in managing diabetes.

It is proven that curbing the intergenerational inheritance of obesity through early intervention during the gestation period has a positive outcome on the body composition, cognitive function, and anxiety level of the offspring. A recent discovery shows that the consumption of Elateriospermum tapos (E. tapos) seed extract modulates body mass and ameliorates stress hormones in obese dams, while a probiotic bacterial strain can cross the placenta and boost a child's memory. Thus, we speculate that probiotics are the best medium to integrate plant extract (E. tapos extract) to access the effect on the child's cognition. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the early intervention of E. tapos yoghurt in obese dams in the cognition and anxiety levels of male offspring. In this study, 40 female rats were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity before pregnancy, while another 8 rats were fed with standard rat pellets for 16 weeks. Upon successful copulation, treatment was initiated for the obese dams up to the postnatal day (PND) 21. The groups included normal chow and saline (NS), HFD and saline (HS), HFD and yoghurt (HY), HFD and 5 mg/kg E. tapos yoghurt (HYT5), HFD and 50 mg/kg E. tapos yoghurt (HYT50), and HFD and 500 mg/kg E. tapos yoghurt (HYT500). All rats were euthanised on PND 21, and the body mass index (BMI), Lee index, and waist circumference were measured for the male offspring. Hippocampal-dependent memory tests and open field tests were conducted to access for cognition and anxiety status. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), total fat (%), insulin, leptin, lipid profile, and antioxidant parameter on serum and hypothalamus (FRAP and GSH) were accessed on PND 21. The result shows male offspring of 50 mg/kg-supplemented obese dams have comparable total fat (%), lipid profile, insulin level, FBG level, plasma insulin level, recognition index, low anxiety level, and improved hypothalamic FRAP and GSH levels to the normal group. In conclusion, this study highlights that the effect of early intervention of our novel formulation of E. tapos yoghurt in obese dams alleviates cognitive deficits and anxiety in male offspring by modulating metabolic profiles at the dose of 50 mg/kg.","2023"

A tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolite that can strongly activate NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in macrophages, itaconate is important in a series of inflammatory-associated diseases via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, its role in type 1 diabetes is unclear. We used 4-octyl itaconate (OI), the cell-permeable itaconate derivate, to explore its preventative and therapeutic effects in mouse models of type 1 diabetes and the potential mechanism of macrophage phenotype reprogramming. The mouse models of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes and spontaneous autoimmune diabetes were used to evaluate the preventative and therapeutic effects of OI, which were performed by measuring blood glucose, insulin level, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion, histopathology examination, flow cytometry, and islet proteomics. The protective effect and mechanism of OI were examined via peritoneal macrophages isolated from STZ-induced diabetic mice and co-cultured MIN6 cells with OI-pre-treated inflammatory macrophages in vitro. Moreover, the inflammatory status of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from type 1 diabetes patients was evaluated after OI treatment. OI ameliorated glycemic deterioration, increased systemic insulin level, and improved glucose metabolism in STZ-induced diabetic mice and non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. OI intervention significantly restored the islet insulitis and beta cell function. OI did not alter the macrophage count but significantly downregulated the proportion of M1 macrophages. Additionally, OI significantly inhibited MAPK activation in macrophages to attenuate the macrophage inflammatory response, eventually improving beta cell dysfunction in vitro. Furthermore, we detected higher IL-1β production upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation in the PBMCs from type 1 diabetes patients, which was attenuated by OI treatment. These results provided the first evidence to date that OI can prevent the progression of glycemic deterioration, excessive inflammation, and beta cell dysfunction predominantly mediated by restricting macrophage M1 polarization in mouse models of type 1 diabetes.","2023"

Diabetes is an important risk factor and a common comorbidity in AMI patients. The higher mortality risk of diabetes-AMI relative to nondiabetes-AMI indicates a need for specific treatment to improve clinical outcome. However, the global metabolic dysregulation of AMI complicated with diabetes is still unclear. We aim to systematically interrogate changes in the metabolic microenvironment immediate to AMI episodes in the absence or presence of diabetes. In this work, quantitative metabolomics was used to investigate plasma metabolic differences between diabetes-AMI (n=59) and nondiabetes-AMI (n=59) patients. A diverse array of perturbed metabolic pathways involving carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid metabolism emerged. In all, our omics-oriented approach defined a metabolic signature of afflicted mitochondrial function aggravated by concurrent diabetes in AMI patients. In particular, our analyses uncovered N-lactoyl-phenylalanine and lysophosphatidylcholines as key functional metabolites that skewed the metabolic picture of diabetes-AMI relative to nondiabetes-AMI. N-lactoyl-phenylalanine was strongly associated with metabolic indicators reflective of mitochondrial overload and negatively correlated with HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin, type A1C) specifically in hyperglycemic AMI, suggestive of its central role in glucose utilization and mitochondrial energy production instrumental to the clinical outcome of diabetes-AMI. Reductions in lysophosphatidylcholines, which were negatively correlated with blood glucose and inflammatory markers, might further compromise glucose expenditure and aggravate inflammation leading to poorer prognosis in diabetes-AMI. As circulating metabolite levels are amenable to therapeutic intervention, such shifts in metabolic signatures provide new clues and potential therapeutic targets specific to the treatment of diabetes-AMI.","2023"

In a randomised crossover study, 15 men with type 1 diabetes underwent two separate hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp experiments during Holter-ECG monitoring. One experiment included a bout of moderate-intensity cycling exercise (60 min) along with declining plasma glucose (PG; Clamp-exercise). In the other experiment, hypoglycaemia was induced with the participants at rest (Clamp-rest). We studied QTc interval, T-peak to T-end (Tpe) interval and hormonal responses during three steady-state phases: (i) baseline (PG 4.0-8.0 mmol/L); (ii) hypoglycaemic phase (PG <3.0 mmol/L); and (iii) recovery phase (PG 4.0-8.0 mmol/L). Both QTc interval and Tpe interval increased significantly from baseline during the hypoglycaemic phase but with no significant difference between test days. These changes were accompanied by an increase in plasma adrenaline and a decrease in plasma potassium on both days. During the recovery phase, ΔQTc interval was longer during Clamp-rest compared to Clamp-exercise, whereas ΔTpe interval remained similar on the two test days. We found that both exercise-related hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia induced at rest can cause QTc-interval prolongation and Tpe-interval prolongation in people with type 1 diabetes. Thus, both scenarios may increase susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias.","2023"

Substantial evidence supports the effectiveness of intermittent energy restriction (IER) in T2D management. However, there are few studies that report intermittent use of a low-calorie pre-prepared food including MFH plants and wholegrains in T2D. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Chinese Medical Nutrition Therapy (CMNT), a MFH plants and wholegrains diet accompanied by IER, on glycemic control and potential mechanism. Ten-week-old diabetic db/db mice were randomly divided into CMNT group (feeding low-calorie mouse CMNT diet in day 1-4 and ad libitum regular chow for up to 7 days per cycle) and control group (ad libitum access to regular chow). The results showed that CMNT reduced fasting blood glucose, improved glucose tolerance with higher insulin secretion, attenuated macrophage infiltration, promoted β-cell proliferation of pancreatic islets, and increased diabetes-improving microbiota (Bacteroides, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Coprococcus_1) in db/db mice. Additionally, we performed a pilot study evaluating CMNT in thirty-nine T2D patients without obesity. Participants with T2D randomly assigned to two groups: CMNT group (receiving a consecutive 5-day low-calorie human CMNT diet with 10 days of habitual eating per cycle for 90 days) and control group (continuing on a normal diet). We observed an improvement in glycemic control in CMNT group with significant reduction in HbA1c, fasting glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose but control group were not affected. After CMNT intervention, the abundance of the phylum Bacteroidetes, and genus Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and Roseburia were significantly higher than baseline in T2D patient, which were closely associated with glycemic control. These findings suggested that CMNT is a promising nutritional intervention approach in diabetes management.","2022"

This study aimed to investigate the preventive effects of chromium (III)-enriched yeast (YCr) on high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFHFD)-induced hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in mice, and further clarify its mechanism of action from the perspective of intestinal microbiomics and liver metabolomics. The results indicated that oral administration of YCr remarkably inhibited the aberrant elevations of body weight, blood glucose and lipid levels, hepatic cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels caused by HFHFD. Liver histological examination showed that oral YCr intervention inhibited HFHFD induced liver lipid accumulation. Besides, 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing showed that YCr intervention was beneficial to ameliorating intestinal microbiota dysbiosis by altering the proportion of some intestinal microbial phylotypes. Correlation-based network analysis indicated that the key intestinal microbial phylotypes intervened by YCr were closely related to some biochemical parameters associated with glucose and lipid metabolism. Liver metabolomics analysis revealed that dietary YCr intervention significantly regulated the levels of some biomarkers involved in purine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, citrate cycle, pyrimidine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and so on. Moreover, dietary YCr intervention regulated the mRNA levels of key genes associated with glucose, cholesterol, fatty acids and bile acids metabolism in liver. These findings suggest that dietary YCr intervention has beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism by regulating intestinal microbiota and liver metabolic pathway, and thus can be served as a functional component to prevent hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia.","2022"

Effects of acute and chronic exercise in hypoxia on cardiovascular and glycemic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review. High Alt Med Biol. 23:301-312, 2022. Background: Exercise in hypoxia (EH, decreased oxygen availability) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic intervention to promote angiogenesis and improve glucose metabolism to a greater extent than exercise under normoxia (normal ambient air) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Currently, there are no studies that systematize the existent evidence. This study aims to systematically review the literature and qualitatively evaluate the effects of acute and chronic EH on cardiovascular and glycemic parameters in T2D patients. Methods: A structured search was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines until March 2021, in the MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) randomized and nonrandomized trials, (2) in complication-free patients with T2D, (3) in which EH was compared with exercise in normoxia or with baseline data, and (4) published in English. Results: Six articles (64 subjects) met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed to data extraction. Four articles investigated the acute effect of EH (33 subjects), and two articles investigated the chronic effect of EH (31 subjects), ranging from 6 to 8 weeks. All studies used a cycle ergometer as exercise. Acute EH benefits insulin sensitivity, blood glucose, vascular endothelial growth factor, and metalloproteinase-9, while chronic EH benefits nitric oxide synthase in erythrocytes, but not brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. Conclusion: Acute EH improves glucose homeostasis in T2D patients, which was not seen with chronic EH. Both acute EH and chronic EH improve angiogenesis regulators, but not vascular function. Despite the putative benefits of EH in patients with T2D, the evidence is still scarce and further research is needed before recommendations can be provided.","2022"

Patients with type II diabetes usually follow a self-management regime as directed by a clinician to help regulate their blood glucose levels. Today, various technology solutions exist to support self-management; however, these solutions tend to be independently built, with little to no research or clinical grounding, which has resulted in poor uptake. In this paper, we propose, develop, and implement a nudge-inspired artificial intelligence (AI)-driven health platform for self-management of diabetes. The proposed platform has been co-designed with patients and clinicians, using the adapted 4-cycle design science research methodology (A4C-DSRM) model. The platform includes (a) a cross-platform mobile application for patients that incorporates a macronutrient detection algorithm for meal recognition and nudge-inspired meal logger, and (b) a web-based application for the clinician to support the self-management regime of patients. Further, the platform incorporates behavioral intervention techniques stemming from nudge theory that aim to support and encourage a sustained change in patient lifestyle. Application of the platform has been demonstrated through an illustrative case study via two exemplars. Further, a technical evaluation is conducted to understand the performance of the MDA to meet the personalization requirements of patients with type II diabetes.","2022"

However, the detailed energy balance alteration caused by TRF remains unclear. This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial using a within-subject cross-over design. Twelve healthy, normal-weighted volunteers (age: 24 ± 2.3 years; BMI: 21.9 ± 1.71 kg/m2; 7 females) were studied under a rigorous control for calorie intakes, physical activities as well as sleep-wake cycle to evaluate the energy balance systematically. Each participant consumed an isocaloric diet within either a 5.5-hour TRF or 11-hour control schedule. All energy intake and excretion were traced and collected and accessed by bomb calorimetry. Energy expenditure and substrates oxidation were monitored in a metabolic chamber. TRF compared with control schedule is associated with a 22.7% increase in fecal energy loss (Δ = 32.25 ± 9.33 Kcal, p = 0.005) and a trend in increasing 14.5% urine energy loss (Δ = 6.67 ± 3.14 Kcal, p = 0.058) without change energy expenditure. In total, a negative energy balance (Δ = -45.95 ± 19.00 Kcal, p = 0.034), which was equal to -2.6% of total energy intake, has been observed during TRF interventions. In the meantime, glycemic profiles, heart rate, respiration rate as well as metabolic flexibility were also improved during TRF intervention. Taken together, our findings unravel the mystery of how TRF regulates energy balance, supporting the use of TRF as an alternative dietary strategy for weight loss.","2022"

An imbalance in the gut microbiota and metabolites can disrupt the function of the intestinal barrier, cause changes in the permeability of the intestinal mucosa and promote the immune inflammatory response, thereby aggravating the fluctuation of blood glucose level and promoting the occurrence and development of the chronic complications of DM. Manipulating the GM and metabolites is a promising therapeutic intervention and is being studied extensively. Shenqi compound (SQC) is a traditional Chinese medicine formulation, which has been widely used to improve T2DM. Studies have demonstrated that SQC can reduce glycemic variability, alleviate the inflammatory response, etc. However, its underlying mechanism remains unknown. Therefore, in this experiment, We administered SQC to Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and evaluated its effect on blood glucose homeostasis and the intestinal mucosal barrier. We identified the profiles of the GM and metabolites with the aid of 16S rDNA gene sequencing and non-target metabolomics analysis. It showed that SQC intervention could reduce glycemic variability, regulate serum levels of glucagon and insulin, and improve injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier of GK rats. In the gut, the ratio of bacteria of the phyla Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes could be improved after SQC intervention. SQC also regulated the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae, Butyricimonas, Bacteroides, Blautia, Roseburia, Lactobacillus, and Rothia. We found out that expression of 40 metabolites was significantly improved after SQC intervention. Further analyses of metabolic pathways indicated that the therapeutic effect of SQC might be related predominantly to its ability to improve gluconeogenesis/glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, citrate cycle, and butanoate metabolism. These results suggest that SQC may exert a beneficial role in T2DM by modulating the GM and metabolites in different pathways.","2022"

Sixty-two sedentary young women (age: 21.9 ± 2.8 years, peak oxygen uptake [V̇O2peak] 25.9 ± 4.5 ml kg-1·min-1) were randomized into one of the four groups, including a normoxic RSIT group (N), RSIT simulating an altitude of 2500 m (H2500), RSIT simulating an incremental altitude of 2500-3400 m (H2500-3400) and a non-exercise control group (C). The training intervention (80 × 6 s all-out cycling sprints with 9 s recovery) was performed three times/week for 4 weeks. Anthropometric measures, V̇O2peak, fasting blood glucose and lipids were assessed during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle before and after the intervention. Compared with the control group, significant increases in V̇O2peak were found in both hypoxic groups (H2500: +8.2%, p < 0.001, d = 0.52; H2500-3400: +10.9%, p < 0.05, d = 0.99) but not in the N group (+3.6%, p > 0.05, d = 0.21) after the intervention, whereas the two hypoxic groups had no difference in V̇O2peak. Blood glucose and lipids, and body composition remained unchanged in all groups. The present study indicates that combining hypoxia with RSIT can enhance the improvement of CRF compared with normoxic RSIT alone in the sedentary young population. Yet, compared with RSIT under stable hypoxia, incremental hypoxia stress in the short-term does not additionally ameliorate CRF.","2022"

A total of 96 T2DM volunteers who met the inclusion criteria were recruited from a hospital in Yangpu, Shanghai. Based on the blood index data of their medical examination results which comprised blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and insulin, 37 volunteers were included in the study. Exercise prescription was determined based on T2DM exercise guidelines combined with medical diagnosis and exercise test results, and the patients were randomly assigned to three groups: HIIT group, MICT group, and control (CON) group. HIIT involved one-minute power cycling (80%-95% maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max)), one-minute passive or active rest (25%-30% VO2max), and two-minute rounds of eight groups. MICT required the use of a power bike for 30 minutes of continuous training (50%-70% VO2max) five times a week. The CON group was introduced to relevant medicine, exercise, and nutrition knowledge. The exercise interventions were completed under the supervision of an exercise instructor and hospital doctors. The same indicators were measured after 12 weeks of intervention, and the results of the two tests within and between groups were analyzed for comparison. The weight index of the MICT intervention showed statistically significant within-group differences (difference = 3.52, 95% CI = 2.11-4.92, p = 0.001 < 0.01); group differences for the MICT and CON groups were also statistically significant (difference = 3.52 ± 2.09, Cd1 = -0.39 ± 1.25, p = 0.004 < 0.01). Body mass index (BMI) analysis revealed that the overall means of BMI indicators were not statistically different between groups (F = 0.369, p = 0.694 > 0.05) and the before and after values of the MICT and CON (difference = -1.30 ± 0.79, Cd1 = -0.18 ± 0.45, p = 0.001 < 0.01). No statistically significant difference was observed in the overall mean VO2max index between the groups after the 12-week intervention (F = 2.51, p = 0.100 > 0.05). A statistically significant difference was found in the overall means of the data between the two groups (difference = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.23-0.40, p = 0.001 < 0.01). Analysis of fasting blood glucose (FBG) indicators revealed statistically significant differences between the MICT and control groups (p = 0.028 < 0.05). Analysis of HbA1c and fasting insulin (FI) indicators revealed no statistically significant difference in the overall HbA1c index after the 12-week exercise intervention (F = 0.523, p = 0.598 > 0.05), and the overall difference before and after the experiment between the groups was statistically significant (F = 6.13, p = 0.006 < 0.01). No statistically significant difference was found in the FI index overall after the 12-week exercise intervention (F = 2.50, p = 0.1 > 0.05). Analysis of systolic blood pressure (SBP) revealed statistically significant difference before and after the HIIT and CON interventions (Hd7 = -1.10 ± 1.79, Cd7 = 1.2 ± 1.31, p = 0.018 < 0.05) and statistically significant difference before and after the MICT and CON interventions (Md7 = -0.99 ± 0.91, Cd7 = 1.40 ± 1.78, p = 0.02 < 0.05). The diastolic blood pressure (DBP) revealed no statistically significant within-group differences before and after. Exercise interventions applying both low-volume HIIT and MICT, with both intensity exercises designed for power cycling, improved health-related indicators in the participants; low-volume HIIT had more time advantage. The current experiment compared HIIT with MICT in a safe manner: 50% of the exercise time produced similar benefits and advantages in the two indicators of VO2max and FI. However, MICT was superior to HIIT in the two indicators of body weight (weight) and BMI. The effect of power cycling on FI has the advantages of both aerobic and resistance exercise, which may optimize the type, intensity, and time of exercise prescription according to the individual or the type of exercise program. Our results provide a reference for the personalization of exercise prescription for patients with T2DM.","2022"

There is also evidence for an association between vitamin D levels and menstrual problems such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and dysmenorrhea. Curcumin, is a bioactive polyphenol constituent of turmeric, that can potentially interact with vitamin D receptors and its molecular targets. This study evaluated the effects of curcumin on vitamin D levels in young women with PMS and dysmenorrhea. In this randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial, women with PMS and dysmenorrhea were divided randomly into experimental and control groups to receive one capsule (500 mg of curcuminoid+ 5 mg piperine, or placebo) daily, from approximately 7 days before until 3 days after menstruation for three consecutive menstrual cycles. Serum vitamin D levels, renal function, and liver enzymes were also measured before and after intervention. A total of 76 subjects (38 in each group) were recruited into the trial. Curcumin significantly increased the median (IQR) serum levels of vitamin D [from 12.8 ng/ml (7.0-24.6) to 16.2 ng/ml (6.4-28.8); P = 0.045], compared with placebo [from 18.6 ng/ml (2.2-26.8) to 21.3 ng/ml (5.2-27.1); P = 0.17]. Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and direct bilirubin were reduced by the end of trial in the curcumin group (p < 0.05), but did not change significantly in the control group (p > 0.05). Finally, no significant differences in levels of fasting blood glucose were detected between curcumin and placebo groups. Curcumin supplementation in women with PMS and dysmenorrhea led to a significant improvement of vitamin D, liver function enzyme test, but did not affect blood glucose.

Fourteen men with type 2 diabetes (T2D) underwent a randomized three crossover intervention: HIIE with cycling; energy expenditure matched MICE with cycling; and a sedentary control [CON]) in postprandial state. Plasma glucose and insulin levels were measured at pre-exercise, postexercise, 1 h postexercise, prelunch and 1 h postlunch, respectively. Responses of areas under the curve (AUC) during 4 h from pre-exercise to 1 h postlunch were also calculated. Both HIIE and MICE decreased plasma glucose and insulin levels during 4 h experimental period compared to CON, with significant intervention × time interaction effects for glucose (P=0.001) and insulin (P=0.006) values evolution. Area under curve (AUCs) for glucose and insulin were reduced in HIIE and MICE compared to CON (P<0.05), whereas no differences were found between HIIE and MICE. Acute HIIE and the matched MICE improve plasma glucose control in the same magnitude in type 2 diabetic men aged 30-50 years.","2022"

To improve recognition and management of SAM in a tertiary hospital in Malawi. The impact of multifaceted quality improvement interventions in process measures pertaining to the identification and management of SAM was assessed. Interventions included focused training for clinical staff, reporting process measures to staff, and mobile phone-based group messaging for enhanced communication. This initiative focused on children aged 6-36 months admitted to Kamuzu Central Hospital in Malawi from September 2019 to March 2020. Before-after comparisons were made with baseline data from the year before, and process measures within this intervention period which included three plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles were compared. During the intervention period, 418 children had SAM and in-hospital mortality was 10.8%, which was not significantly different from the baseline period. Compared with the baseline period, there was significant improvement in the documentation of full anthropometrics on admission, blood glucose test within 24 hours of admission and HIV testing results by discharge. During the intervention period, amidst increasing patient census with each PDSA cycle, three process measures were maintained (documentation of full anthropometrics, determination of nutritional status and HIV testing results), and there was significant improvement in blood glucose documentation. Significant improvement in key quality measures represents early progress towards the larger goal of improving patient outcomes, most notably mortality, in children admitted with SAM.","2021"

Research has lacked in investigating whether individuals that do not respond to the training intervention ( V˙O2max ), also do not improve in other health-related parameters. We aimed to investigate the cardiovascular and metabolic adaptations (i.e., performance, body composition, blood pressure, vascular function, fasting blood markers, and resting cardiac function and morphology) to exercise training among participants who showed different levels of V˙O2max responsiveness. Healthy sedentary participants engaged in a 6-week exercise training program, three times a week. Our results showed that responders had a greater increase in peak power output, second lactate threshold, and microvascular responsiveness, whereas non-responders had a greater increase in cycling efficiency. No statistical differences were observed in body composition, blood pressure, fasting blood parameters, and resting cardiac adaptations. In conclusion, our study showed, for the first time, that in addition to the differences in the V˙O2max , a greater increase in microvascular responsiveness in responders compared to non-responders was observed. Additionally, responders and non-responders did not show differences in the adaptations on metabolic parameters.

Whether we refer to COVID-19 as a pandemic (a widely used word) or a syndemic (a new emerging term), we now know that specific immunotypes have been linked to both risk to infection and presentation of this disease. Application of assessment tools that support a fuller understanding of individual immune system status is next-level care that providers must prepare for and deliver. Commonly used biometric devices already gather data that can be relevant and useful to a phenotypic evaluation of immune function. These variables include pulse rate, blood oxygenation, sleep cycles, respiration rate, heart rate variability, continuous blood glucose monitoring, and ambulatory blood pressure. When coupled with traditional blood analytes and measurements of nutrient status, a more complete picture of immunological function may be revealed. Innovative questionnaires and algorithms can also be helpful additions to a clinician's toolkit. In a therapeutic relationship between provider and patient, this approach may lead to options for personalized immune intervention using diet, medical nutrition, and lifestyle medicine.","2021"

Since life-long pharmacotherapy with alagebrium chloride (ALT) slows progression to experimental T1D, we hypothesized that acute ALT therapy delivered prediabetes, may be effective. However, in female, non-obese diabetic (NODShiLt) mice, ALT administered prediabetes (day 50-100) did not protect against experimental T1D. ALT did not decrease circulating AGEs or their precursors. Despite this, pancreatic β-cell function was improved, and insulitis and pancreatic CD45.1+ cell infiltration was reduced. Lymphoid tissues were unaffected. ALT pre-treatment, prior to transfer of primed GC98 CD8+ T cell receptor transgenic T cells, reduced blood glucose concentrations and delayed diabetes, suggesting islet effects rather than immune modulation by ALT. Indeed, ALT did not reduce interferon-γ production by leukocytes from ovalbumin-pre-immunised NODShiLt mice and NODscid recipients given diabetogenic ALT treated NOD splenocytes were not protected against T1D. To elucidate β-cell effects, NOD-derived MIN6N8 β-cell major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class Ia surface antigens were examined using immunopeptidomics. Overall, no major changes in the immunopeptidome were observed during the various treatments with all peptides exhibiting allele specific consensus binding motifs. As expected, longer MHC Class Ia peptides were captured bound to H-2Db than H-2Kb under all conditions. Moreover, more 10-12 mer peptides were isolated from H-2Db after AGE modified bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA) treatment, compared with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or AGE-BSA+ALT treatment. Proteomics of MIN6N8 cells showed enrichment of processes associated with catabolism, the immune system, cell cycling and presynaptic endocytosis with AGE-BSA compared with BSA treatments. These data show that short-term ALT intervention, given prediabetes, does not arrest experimental T1D but transiently impacts β-cell function.","2021"

Sixty healthy male SD mice without specific pathogens (SPF grade) were selected, and numbered by statistical software to randomize into control group (CG; n=20), model group (MG; n=20) and research group (RG; n=20). Mice in CG were given regular diet, while those in MG and RG were fed with high fat diet. Subsequently, RG was given Res intervention while MG received no treatment. Biochemical indexes [triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), fasting blood glucose (FBG), 24-hour urinary albumin excretion rate (24h-UAER)] of mice in the three groups before and after intervention were observed and recorded. The effect of Res on oxidative stress, kidney histopathological structure, spermatogenic function, sperm density and viability of mice, as well as spermatogenic cell cycle of testis were determined. Res reduced hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in T2D mice. By reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), Res relieved oxidative stress and alleviated kidney tissue damage. In addition, Res improved the spermatogenic function of T2D mice by increasing the sperm density and survival rate and restoring the percentage of spermatogenic cells at all levels. Res intervention in T2D mice can reduce kidney tissue damage, lower blood glucose (BG), and improve spermatogenic function by increasing sperm density and restoring the percentage of spermatogenic cells at all levels.","2021"

However, there is a lack of research on TRE in shift workers including firefighters. This study aims to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of 10-hour TRE on health parameters that contribute to cardiometabolic disease risks among career firefighters who work on a 24-hour shift schedule. The Healthy Heroes Study is a randomised controlled parallel open-label clinical trial with 150 firefighters over 1 year. Firefighters are randomised with a 1:1 ratio to either the control or intervention group. The control group receives Mediterranean diet nutritional counselling (standard of care, 'SOC'). The intervention group receives the same SOC and a self-selected 10-hour TRE window. After the 2-week baseline, participants enter a 3-month monitored intervention, followed by a 9-month self-guided period with follow-up assessments. The impact of TRE on blood glucose, body weight, body composition, biomarkers (neuroendocrine, inflammatory and metabolic), sleep and mood is evaluated. These assessments occur at baseline, at the end of intervention and at 6, 9 and 12-month follow-ups.

In addition, the levels of IL-4, IL-10, CTX- II and TGF-β in the UC II group were 1.74, 2.23, 1.67 and 1.84 times higher than those in the OM group, respectively, while the levels of MMP-3 and MMP-13 in the UC II group were half those in the OM group. Correspondingly, UC II intervention significantly decreased the scores of pain, stiffness and physical function (p < 0.05), whereas the 6 MWT and total MET distances in the UC II group increased remarkably (p < 0.05). After a three-month period of intervention, the varus angle significantly decreased from 4.6 ± 2.0° to 3.0 ± 1.4° and the knee flexion range obviously increased from 57.9 ± 14.0° to 66.9 ± 10.4°. Importantly, the declining trend in the levels of hs-CRP and MDA and the incremental trend in the SOD level were consistent in the db/db mice and OA patients following UC II administration.","2021"

Exposure to hypoxic conditions during exercise training positively changes the physiological response in healthy subjects. Exposure to hypoxic conditions during exercise could markedly increase skeletal muscle glucose uptake compared to that in normoxic conditions. Furthermore, post-exercise insulin sensitivity of T2DM patients increases more when exercising under hypoxic than under normoxic conditions. Regular exercise under short-term hypoxic conditions can improve blood glucose control at lower workloads than in normoxic conditions. Additionally, exercise training under short-term hypoxic conditions can maximize weight loss in overweight and obese patients. Previous studies on healthy subjects have reported that regular exercise under hypoxic conditions had a more positive effect on vascular health than exercising under normoxic conditions. However, currently, evidence indicating that exposure to hypoxic conditions could positively affect T2DM patients in the long-term is lacking. Therefore, further evaluations of the beneficial effects of exercise under hypoxic conditions on the human body, considering different cycle lengths, duration of exposures, sessions per day, and the number of days, are necessary. In this review, we conclude that there is evidence that exercise under hypoxic conditions can yield health benefits, which is potentially valuable in terms of clinical care as a new intervention for T2DM patients.","2021"

Since anxiolytic drugs target mitochondria, non-pharmacological approaches to improve mitochondrial metabolism such as intermittent fasting (IF) may cause parallel behavioral benefits against anxiety disorders. Here, we investigated whether a chronic IF regimen could induce anxiolytic-like effects concomitantly to modulation in mitochondrial bioenergetics and trophic signaling in mice brain. A total of 44 Male C57BL/6 J mice (180 days old) were assigned to two dietary regimens: a normal, ad libitum diet (AL group) and an alternate-day fasting (IF group), where animals underwent 10 cycles of 24 h food restriction followed by 24 h ad libitum access. Animals underwent the open field test, dark/light box and elevated plus maze tasks. Isolated nerve terminals were obtained from mice brain and used for mitochondrial respirometry, hydrogen peroxide production and assessment of membrane potential dynamics, calcium handling and western blotting. We showed that IF significantly alters total daily food intake and food consumption patterns but not body weight. There were no differences in the exploratory and locomotory parameters. Remarkably, animals from IF showed decreased anxiety-like behavior. Mitochondrial metabolic responses in different coupling states and parameters linked with H2O2 production, Ca2+ buffering and electric gradient were not different between groups. Finally, no alterations in molecular indicators of apoptotic death (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio) and neuroplasticity (proBDNF/BDNF and synaptophysin were observed). In conclusion, IF exerts anxiolytic-like effect not associated with modulation in synaptic neuronergetics or expression of neurotrophic proteins. These results highlight a potential benefit of intermittent fasting as a nutritional intervention in anxiety-related disorders.","2021"

The identification of other biomarkers could provide an alternative or adjunct diagnostic method, to allow early intervention before laminitis develops. The present study characterised the metabolome of ponies with varying degrees of ID using basal and postprandial plasma samples obtained during a previous study, which examined the predictive power of blood insulin levels for the development of laminitis, in ponies fed a high-sugar diet. Samples from 10 pre-laminitic (PL - subsequently developed laminitis) and 10 non-laminitic (NL - did not develop laminitis) ponies were used in a targeted metabolomic assay. Differential concentration and pathway analysis were performed using linear models and global tests. Significant changes in the concentration of six glycerophospholipids (adj. P ≤ 0.024) and a global enrichment of the glucose-alanine cycle (adj. P = 0.048) were found to characterise the response of PL ponies to the high-sugar diet. In contrast, the metabolites showed no significant association with the presence or absence of pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction in all ponies. The present results suggest that ID and laminitis risk are associated with alterations in the glycerophospholipid and glucose metabolism, which may help understand and explain some molecular processes causing or resulting from these conditions. The prognostic value of the identified biomarkers for laminitis remains to be investigated in further metabolomic trials in horses and ponies.","2021"

Sixteen (eight males and eight females) recreationally active individuals, aged (mean ± SD) 22 ± 7 years, participated with a seven-day period between interventions. The high-intensity interval exercise trial consisted of twelve, 30 s cycling intervals at 80% of peak power capacity and 90 s active recovery. The resistance exercise trial consisted of four sets of 10 repetitions for three lower-limb exercises at 80% 1-RM, matched for duration of high-intensity interval exercise. Exercise was performed after an overnight fast, with blood samples collected every 30 min, for two hours after exercise. There was a significant interaction between time and intervention for glucose (p = 0.02), which was, on average (mean ± SD), 0.7 ± 0.7 mmol∙L-1 higher following high-intensity interval exercise, as compared to resistance exercise. Cortisol concentration over time was affected by intervention (p = 0.03), with cortisol 70 ± 103 ng∙mL-1 higher (p = 0.015), on average, following high-intensity interval exercise. Resistance exercise did not induce the acute rise in glucose that was induced by high-intensity interval exercise and appears to be an appropriate alternative to positively regulate blood glucose.","2021"

In fact, PTDM is a risk factor for both infection and cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence and incidence of PTDM have a bimodal evolution: early (up to 3 months) and late PTDM (beyond 12 months). The majority of late PTDM occurs in subjects with prediabetes after transplantation. So, treating patients with prediabetes, a potentially reversible condition, might help preventing PTDM. In the general population, exercise prevents the evolution from prediabetes to diabetes. However, in renal transplantation, not enough evidence is available in this field. We designed an exploratory analysis to evaluate the feasibility of exercise to reverse prediabetes as a first step in the design of a trial to prevent PTDM. Only patients with prediabetes beyond 12 months after transplantation with capacity to perform exercise will be included. Prediabetes will be diagnosed based on fasting glucose levels and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). Patients will be treated with a stepped training intervention, starting with aerobic exercise training (brisk walking, swimming, and cycling) 5 times per week and 30 min/day. Aerobic exercise training will be gradually increased to 60 min/day or eventually combined with anaerobic exercise training in case of persistent prediabetes.

Ambient hyperglycemia has been implicated in this exercise response heterogeneity. The current study investigated whether pre-exercise hyperglycemia directly impacts the effect of exercise on glycemic control. Twelve healthy normal glucose-tolerant males completed four trials in a randomized, crossover design. Each trial consisted of 24-h pre-intervention monitoring, a 7-h intervention, and 24-h post-intervention monitoring. Glycemic control was measured throughout the study by continuous glucose monitoring. The four interventions were no exercise (CON) or 45 min of cycling exercise (70%HRmax) preceded by 3.5 h of either normoglycemia (NG-Ex), steady-state hyperglycemia induced by constant glucose infusion (HG-Ex) or fluctuating glycemia induced by repeated glucose bolus infusions (FG-Ex). Physical activity and diet were similar between trials, and energy expenditure during exercise was matched between exercise trials (all P > 0.05). Mean glucose during the 3.5 h ± infusion period was higher in HG-Ex (mean ± SEM; 7.2 ± 0.4 mmol/L) and FG-Ex (7.3 ± 0.3 mmol/L) compared to CON (4.8 ± 0.2 mmol/L) and NG-Ex (5.0 ± 0.2 mmol/L) trials (P < 0.01). Glycemic variability was greatest in FG-Ex (P < 0.01). Following the interventions, the postprandial glucose response (iAUC) was reduced by exercise in NG-Ex compared to CON (321.1 ± 38.6 vs. 445.5 ± 49.7 mmol/L.8h, P < 0.05, d=0.81).

Patients and Methods. A total of 22 patients with PCOS with phlegm-dampness syndrome, 21 PCOS patients with nonphlegm-dampness syndrome, and 20 control volunteers were selected for this study. The general index, sex hormone index, fasting blood glucose (FPG), and serum fasting insulin (FINS) were determined in each of the groups. The intestinal flora of each group was determined by the 16s rDNA high-throughput sequencing technique. Besides, the PCOS with phlegm-dampness syndrome group was treated with Jiawei Qi Gong Wan, and the changes in TCM syndrome, sex hormone index, BMI, WHR, FPG, FINS, HOMA-IR, and intestinal flora were determined before and after treatment. PCOS patients with phlegm-dampness syndrome showed characteristics of obesity and insulin resistance. There were several differences in both structure and function of the intestinal flora between PCOS patients with phlegm-dampness syndrome, PCOS patients with nonphlegm-dampness syndrome, and the control group. An imbalance in the intestinal flora may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of PCOS with phlegm-dampness syndrome and also has a specific influence on glucose and lipid metabolism, obesity, and the menstrual cycle in PCOS patients with phlegm-dampness syndrome. Besides, the imbalance is associated with a decrease in the number of butyrate-producing bacteria, an increase in the number of lipopolysaccharide-producing bacteria, and an increase in proinflammatory bacteria. The intestinal flora in PCOS patients with phlegm-dampness syndrome was found to be linked to obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperandrogenemia. Treatment with Jiawei Qi Gong Wan was found to increase the diversity of intestinal flora, increase the number of intestinal probiotics, and improve the structure and functional genes of intestinal flora which improved the state of insulin resistance, regulated endocrine metabolism, and improved the overall symptoms.

"32973635","Zhao Qian; Zhang Yonggang; Liao Xiaoyang; Wang Weiwen","Executive Function and Diabetes: A Clinical Neuropsychology Perspective.","Diabetes is a global public health concern. Management of diabetes depends on successful implementation of strategies to alleviate decline in executive functions (EFs), a characteristic of diabetes progression. In this review, we describe recent research on the relationship between diabetes and EF, summarize the existing evidence, and put forward future research directions and applications. Herein, we provide an overview of recent studies, to elucidate the relationship between DM and EF. We identified new screening objectives, management tools, and intervention targets for diabetes management. We also discuss the implications for clinical practice. In both types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperglycemia substantially impairs EF in people of all age groups and ethnicities. Hypoglycemia can similarly impair EF. Interestingly, a decline in EF contributes to DM progression. Glucose dysregulation and EF decline exacerbate each other in a vicious cycle: poor blood glucose control, impaired EF, diabetes management task failure, then back to poor blood glucose control. Many pathophysiological indexes (e.g., obesity, metabolic index, inflammatory and immune factors), neuropsychological indexes (e.g., compliance, eating habits, physical exercise, sleep, and depression), and genetic factors are changed by this pathological interaction between DM and EF. These changes can provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of diabetes-related EF decline. Further studies, including large-scale prospective and randomized controlled trials, are needed to elucidate the mechanism of the interaction between diabetes and EF and to develop novel strategies for breaking this cycle.","2020"

The data were from the BHS cohort consisting of two periods: cycle 1 (2005-2006; n = 1712; 119 families) and cycle 2 (2010-2013; n = 3017; 127 families). A total of 1121 individuals (both sexes, 18-100 years) were selected if they were assessed in both cycles and not diagnosed with T2DM at baseline (cycle 1). Our findings showed that a participant's risk of developing T2DM increased almost 10 times for a one-unit increase in the TyG (odds ratio OR = 10.17, 95% CI, 7.51-13.93). The association when stratified by age was OR = 28.13 [95% CI, 14.03-56.41] for young adults, meaning that the risk of developing T2DM increased more than 28 times for a one-unit increase in the TyG. For the other groups, young middle-aged adults, old middle-aged adults, and seniors, we found OR = 4.84 [95% CI, 2.91-8.06], OR = 28.73 [95% CI, 10.63-77.65, and OR = 9.88 [95% CI, 3.16-30.90], respectively. A higher TyG implies a significant increase in the risk of developing T2DM, which could be an important screening tool to target early lifestyle intervention in Brazil.","2020"

A supervised exercise intervention with baseline to follow-up comparison between overweight (BMI = 28.6 ± 2.1 kg/m2) and normal weight (BMI = 23.2 ± 1.40 kg/m2) T1DM patients was performed. Eleven overweight (age = 40.7 ± 14.3 years) and 11 normal weight (age = 42.2 ± 15.5 years) T1DM patients performed a four-week, low-volume, all-out cycling HIIT (4-6 bouts, work/relief ratio 1:1) twice weekly. HIIT lowered low-density lipoprotein and uric acid levels in overweight patients by up to 10.5% (vs. normal weight, p≤0.0312). HbA1c, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels did not change in any of the groups. Participants' maximal exercise capacity and power output at individual anaerobic lactate threshold increased to an equal extend of up to 10% (p≤0.0002) in both groups. During the intervention, participants used fewer daily bolus insulin (-5.22 ± 12.80%) and less total units of insulin (-4.42 ± 10.20%, p≤0.023) compared to the pre-intervention period with no between-group difference. Overall, the average daily number of hypoglycaemias increased from 0.90 ± 0.56-1.08 ± 0.63 during the intervention (p = 0.033). SF-36 subscales showed higher scores after the intervention, with a significant improvement of ""role limitations due to physical problems"" (p<0.05) for both groups. We conclude that in T1DM, HIIT may exert beneficial effects on physical fitness, insulin requirement and health-related quality of life. Of note, beneficial HIIT effects on the cardiometabolic risk profile in T1DM may be larger in overweight T1DM patients.","2021"

Resistant starch 3 (RS3), as a starch resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis owing to its special structure, has a good effect on improving insulin resistance and reducing blood sugar in T2DM patients. However, the possible mechanisms were barely interpreted yet. In our research, we aimed to evaluate the effects and the possible mechanisms of RS3 on the treatment of T2DM. ICR mice treated with high-fat diet (HFD) for eight weeks, and then injected with streptozotocin (STZ) (100 mg/kg) to establish the T2DM. We choose the mice with the fast blood glucose (FBG) more than 11 mmol/L as T2DM. After treated for 11 weeks the relevant data was analyzed. According to the results, the FBG was dramatically reduced (p < 0.05), which also downregulated triglyceride (p < 0.01) and total cholesterol (p < 0.01). Additionally, the insulin resistance indexes were significantly reduced (p < 0.01), the homeostasis model assessment-β and insulin-sensitive index were significantly improved (p < 0.01) in RS3 group. Meanwhile, the metabolic profiles of urine were analyzed and 29 potential biomarkers were screened out, including amino acids and lipids. In conclusion, we speculated that the tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism played roles in the therapeutic mechanisms of RS3 on T2DM.","2020"

Using continuous glucose monitors, glucose was measured up to 48 h after the OGTT. Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were determined at baseline and after 1 and 2 h. One hour after glucose intake, mean blood glucose was significantly lower after cycling compared with rest (p = 0.002). Similarly, mean glucose peak level was significantly lower after cycling compared with after rest (p = 0.039). Lower levels of insulin and C-peptide were observed after 1 h (p < 0.01).

Increased sympathetic tone contributes to long-term health risks for cardiovascular disease and promotes PCOS pathogenesis. To determine whether weekly osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) improves physiologic measures of sympathetic tone in women with PCOS. In the second phase of a larger study from this author group, 25 women with PCOS, aged 22 to 43 years, living in Erie, Pennsylvania, were recruited to participate in a randomized, controlled evaluation of OMT intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to either an OMT intervention or control group. The OMT group received weekly manipulation of Chapman points and rib-raising for viscerosomatic reflexes associated with the ovaries, adrenal glands, and heart for 12 consecutive weeks. Physiologic measures of sympathetic tone were collected, along with metabolic, endocrine, and reproductive measurements, both before the 3-month intervention and within 1 week of completing the intervention. Measurements included heart rate and blood pressure at rest and after 15 minutes of aerobic exercise, heart rate recovery after exercise, resting heart rate variability, serum androgen levels, body mass index, fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, and menstrual cycle length. Nineteen women completed the study. Comparing pre- and postintervention parameters, women with PCOS in the OMT intervention group experienced an improvement in postexercise systolic blood pressure (135.8 vs 129.1 mm Hg) and a trend toward heart rate recovery (23.2 vs 29.4 seconds). No significant improvements were found in the control group or in any other physiologic parameters measured. No significant improvements were found in the endocrine, metabolic, or reproductive parameters measured, although free testosterone was slightly lower after 3 months of weekly OMT (5.69 vs 4.64 pg/mL). Improvements in sympathetic tone after OMT suggest that weekly manipulation of Chapman points and viscerosomatic reflexes can be a useful adjunctive therapeutic option for women with PCOS.

Huanglian Decoction (HLD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) preparation that has been used to treat T2DM for thousands of years in China. However, its mechanism of action at the metabolic level is still unclear. The purpose of this work is to study the mechanism of HLD in treating T2DM based on metabolomics and network pharmacology. In this study, metabolomics combined with network pharmacology was used to elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of HLD in T2DM. Serum samples were collected from rats with T2DM, induced by a high-sugar and high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin (STZ), to measure the levels of biochemical markers. Urinary metabolomics-based analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was conducted to evaluate the differential metabolites from multiple metabolic pathways. After treatment with HLD for 4 weeks, biochemical indicators, including fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood lipid, fasting insulin (FINS), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), were significantly improved. Metabolomics results revealed that HLD regulated the biomarkers, such as cytosine, L-carnitine, betaine, phenylalanine, glucose, citrate, phenylpyruvate, and hippuric acid in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The combination of network pharmacology, metabolomics, western blot, and PCR showed that HLD can treat T2DM by enhancing the gene and protein expression levels of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), insulin receptor (INSR), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) to interfere with glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. The study based on metabolomics and network pharmacology indicated that HLD can improve T2DM through multiple targets and pathways, and it may be a useful alternative therapy for the treatment of T2DM.","2020"

Thus, we conducted this review of controlled clinical trials that provided dietary polyphenols from oils, fruits, teas, and legumes during a dietary challenge, or implemented walking, cycling, and stair climbing and descending after a dietary challenge. Clinical trials were identified using ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and Google Scholar and were published between 2000 and 2019. Dietary polyphenols from extra virgin olive oil, grapes, blackcurrants, strawberries, black tea, and black beans improved postprandial glucose, insulin, and markers of oxidative damage and inflammation, but results were not consistent among clinical trials. Freeze-dried strawberry powder distinctly improved postprandial insulin and markers of oxidative damage and inflammation.

Isolated rat islets, βTC3 cells and T2DM mice were used in this study. The results showed that CHS restored the secretion activity, promoted β cell survival by increasing β cell proliferation and decreasing apoptosis which induced by intermittent high glucose (IHG). In vivo, CHS protected β cell apoptosis to normalize blood glucose and improve insulin sensitivity in DM mice. Further studies showed that CHS activated Wnt3a signaling, inhibited HBP1, promoted β-catenin nuclear translocation, enhanced expressions of TCF7L2, GIPR and GLP-1R, inhibited p53, p27 and p21. The protective effect of CHS was remarkably suppressed by siRNAs against TCF7L2 or XAV-939 (a Wnt/β-catenin antagonist) in vitro and in β-catenin-/- mice.

This is called impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH), the cause of which is unknown. We recently proposed that IAH develops through habituation, a form of adaptive memory to preceding hypoglycaemia. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrated restoration of defective counterregulatory hormonal responses to hypoglycaemia (referred to as dishabituation) in a rodent model of IAH following introduction of a novel stress stimulus (high intensity training [HIT]). In this proof-of-concept study we sought to further test this hypothesis by examining whether a single episode of HIT would amplify counterregulatory responses to subsequent hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes who had IAH (assessed by Gold score ≥4, modified Clarke score ≥4 or Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating (DAFNE) hypoglycaemia awareness rating 2 or 3). The primary outcome was the difference in adrenaline response to hypoglycaemia following both a single episode of HIT and rest. In this randomised, crossover study 12 participants aged between 18 and 55 years with type 1 diabetes for ≥5 years and an HbA1c <75 mmol/mol (9%) were recruited. Individuals were randomised using computer generated block randomisation to start with one episode of HIT (4 × 30 s cycle sprints [2 min recovery] at 150% of maximum wattage achieved during [Formula: see text] assessment) or rest (control). The following day they underwent a 90 min hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp study at 2.5 mmol/l with measurement of hormonal counterregulatory response, symptom scores and cognitive testing (four-choice reaction time and digit symbol substitution test). Each intervention and subsequent clamp study was separated by at least 2 weeks. The participants and investigators were not blinded to the intervention or measurements during the study. The investigators were blinded to the primary outcome and blood analysis results. All participants (six male and six female, age 19-54 years, median [IQR] duration of type 1 diabetes 24.5 [17.3-29.0] years, mean [SEM] HbA1c 56 [3.67] mmol/mol; 7.3% [0.34%]) completed the study (both interventions and two clamps). In comparison with the rest study, a single episode of HIT led to a 29% increase in the adrenaline (epinephrine) response (mean [SEM]) (2286.5 [343.1] vs 2953.8 [384.9] pmol/l); a significant increase in total symptom scores (Edinburgh Hypoglycaemia Symptom Scale: 24.25 [2.960 vs 27.5 [3.9]; p<0.05), and a significant prolongation of four-choice reaction time (591.8 [22.5] vs 659.9 [39.86] ms; p<0.01] during equivalent hypoglycaemia induced the following day. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that IAH develops in people with type 1 diabetes as a habituated response and that introduction of a novel stressor can restore, at least partially, the adapted counterregulatory hormonal, symptomatic and cognitive responses to hypoglycaemia.

This study aimed to evaluate the short-term cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive intervention program for blood glucose management in different groups using a Markov model. Based on real-world data, a Markov model was developed to calculate the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The division of Markov states was in accordance with clinical practice. A three-month cycle length and a 5-year time horizon were applied. A 3% discounting rate was applied for both the costs and utilities. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) was more favorable for the male group than the female group, with an associated ICER of 104 K RMB per QALY gained. Compared with the younger group, the incremental gain of the middle-aged group was -0.062 QALY, and the incremental cost was -3,198.64 RMB; meanwhile, the incremental gain of the elderly group was -0.176 QALY, and the incremental cost was 4,485.746 RMB. The sensitivity analysis showed that the ICER is sensitive to the costs of this program and less sensitive to the discounting rate and the time horizon. The comprehensive intervention program for blood glucose management of overweight and obese patients with diabetes is cost-effective for the middle-aged male group and elderly female group, respectively. Moreover, the male group was more favorable than the female group if three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was adopted as the maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for a QALY in China.","2019"

The metabolomics results revealed that after treatment with HD, the levels of L-carnitine, 1-methyladenosine, 1-methylhistamine, and 3-indoleacrylic acid were upregulated and the levels of riboflavin, phenylalanine, atrolactic acid, 2-oxoglutarate, citrate, isocitrate, cortisol, and glucose were downregulated. The main mechanism may be closely related to the regulation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, phenylalanine metabolism, glyoxylate metabolism, and dicarboxylate metabolism. Additionally, it was also found that HD can regulate the protein expression of GLUT4 and AMPK to interfere with TCA cycle and carbohydrate metabolism to treat T2DM.","2019"

This comorbidity is related to a poorer quality of life, microvascular complications, a decline in lung function, and an increase in exacerbations, as well as delayed growth and puberty. Evidence exists that physical exercise contributes to glycemic control in individuals with non-CF-related diabetes. This exercise is usually continuous with moderate intensity and long duration, which can cause muscle dyspnea and fatigue in CF individuals. Aerobic interval training (AIT) emerges as a safe and effective alternative for treating these individuals. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of AIT on glucose tolerance in children and adolescents with CF. This study will be a two-arm, prospectively registered, randomized controlled trial with blind assessors and twenty 6- to 18-year-old individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) from two different Brazilian states. People with CF will be randomly allocated to either the experimental or control group using block randomization, stratified by puberty stage,. Participants from both groups will receive an educational intervention and will be asked to continue their usual daily treatment for the full duration of the study. Those in the experimental group will perform AIT on a cycle ergometer at home three times a week, for 8 consecutive weeks. The sample characterization will include an assessment of puberty stage, socioeconomic status, dyspnea, and anthropometry. The primary outcome will be the change in glucose tolerance, while the secondary outcomes will include lung function, exercise tolerance, respiratory muscle strength, quality of life, and CF exacerbations. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, week 9, and week 17. This is the first study to evaluate the effects of AIT on glucose tolerance in children and adolescents with CF. This study will serve as a basis for guiding clinical practice and decision-making in treating glucose intolerance and CF-related diabetes (CFRD) in children and adolescents with CF.

This symposium review provides an overview of the recent work investigating whether a virtually monitored home-based high-intensity interval training (Home-HIT) intervention reduces the fear of hypoglycaemia and other common barriers to exercise in people with type 1 diabetes. What advances does it highlight? Home-HIT seems to offer a strategy to reduce fear of hypoglycaemia, while simultaneously removing other known barriers that prevent people with type 1 diabetes from taking up exercise, because it is time efficient, requires no travel time or costs associated with gym memberships, and allows people to exercise in their chosen environment. People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are recommended to engage in regular exercise for a variety of health and fitness reasons. However, many lead a sedentary lifestyle and fail to meet the physical activity guidelines, in part because of the challenge of managing blood glucose concentration and fear of hypoglycaemia. A number of strategies designed to help people with T1D to manage their blood glucose during and after exercise have been investigated. Although many of these strategies show promise in facilitating blood glucose management during and after exercise, they do not target the many other common barriers to exercise that people with T1D face, such as difficulty with cost and travel time to gyms, limited access to exercise bikes and treadmills, and a possible dislike of exercising in front of others in public places. In this symposium review, we provide an overview of ongoing research into a virtually monitored home-based high-intensity interval training (Home-HIT) programme that is designed to reduce these other common barriers to exercise. The conclusion of this review is that Home-HIT seems to offer a strategy to reduce fear of hypoglycaemia, while simultaneously removing other known barriers preventing people with T1D from taking up exercise, such as being time efficient, requiring no travel time or costs associated with gym memberships, and giving them the opportunity to exercise in their chosen environment, reducing the embarrassment experienced by some when exercising in public.","2020"

Functional electrical stimulation (FES) and surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)-resistance training (RT) have emerged as effective rehabilitation methods that can exercise muscles below the level of injury and attenuate cardio-metabolic risk factors. Our aims are to determine the impact of 12 weeks of NMES + 12 weeks of FES-lower extremity cycling (LEC) compared to 12 weeks of passive movement + 12 weeks of FES-LEC on: (1) oxygen uptake (VO2), insulin sensitivity, and glucose disposal in adults with SCI; (2) skeletal muscle size, intramuscular fat (IMF), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT); and (3) protein expression of energy metabolism, protein molecules involved in insulin signaling, muscle hypertrophy, and oxygen uptake and electron transport chain (ETC) activities. Forty-eight persons aged 18-65 years with chronic (> 1 year) SCI/D (AIS A-C) at the C5-L2 levels, equally sub-grouped by cervical or sub-cervical injury levels and time since injury, will be randomized into either the NMES + FES group or Passive + FES (control group). The NMES + FES group will undergo 12 weeks of evoked RT using twice-weekly NMES and ankle weights followed by twice-weekly progressive FES-LEC for an additional 12 weeks. The control group will undergo 12 weeks of passive movement followed by 12 weeks of progressive FES-LEC. Measurements will be performed at baseline (B; week 0), post-intervention 1 (P1; week 13), and post-intervention 2 (P2; week 25), and will include: VO2 measurements, insulin sensitivity, and glucose effectiveness using intravenous glucose tolerance test; magnetic resonance imaging to measure muscle, IMF, and VAT areas; muscle biopsy to measure protein expression and intracellular signaling; and mitochondrial ETC function. Training through NMES + RT may evoke muscle hypertrophy and positively impact oxygen uptake, insulin sensitivity, and glucose effectiveness. This may result in beneficial outcomes on metabolic activity, body composition profile, mitochondrial ETC, and intracellular signaling related to insulin action and muscle hypertrophy. In the future, NMES-RT may be added to FES-LEC to improve the workloads achieved in the rehabilitation of persons with SCI and further decrease muscle wasting and cardio-metabolic risks.

We report on the implementation and fidelity of a Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) intervention, evaluated through a three-arm cluster randomised controlled trial which reduced the incidence of diabetes and intermediate hyperglycaemia in rural Bangladesh. PLA interventions have been effective in addressing population level health problems in low income country contexts, and therefore we sought to use this approach to engage communities to identify and address community barriers to prevention and control of type 2 diabetes. We used a mixed methods approach collecting quantitative data through field reports and qualitative data through observations and focus group discussions. Through descriptive analysis, we considered fidelity to the participatory approach and implementation plans. One hundred twenty-two groups per month were convened by 16 facilitators and supervised by two coordinators. Groups worked through a four phase PLA cycle of problem identification, planning together, implementation and evaluation to address the risk factors for diabetes - diet, physical activity, smoking and stress. Groups reported a lack of awareness about diabetes prevention and control, the prohibitive cost of care and healthy eating, and gender barriers to exercise for women. Groups set targets to encourage physical activity, kitchen-gardening, cooking with less oil, and reduced tobacco consumption. Anti-tobacco committees operated in 90 groups. One hundred twenty-two groups arranged blood glucose testing and 74 groups organized testing twice. Forty-one women's groups established funds, and 61 communities committed not to ridicule women exercising. Experienced and committed supervisors enabled fidelity to a participatory methodology. A longer intervention period and capacity building could enable engagement with systems barriers to behaviour change. Our complex intervention was implemented as planned and is likely to be valid in similar contexts given the flexibility of the participatory approach to contextually specific barriers to prevention and control of type 2 diabetes. Fidelity to the participatory approach is key to implementing the intervention and effectively addressing type 2 diabetes in a low-income country.","2019"

This study investigated the involvement of MPC1 in hepatic glucagon response, in order to identify a possible pharmacological intervention. The correlation between hepatic glucagon response and MPC1 induction was investigated in fasted mice and primary hepatocytes. The effects of ginsenoside Rb1 on MPC1 function were observed. Glucagon challenge raised blood glucose with hepatic MPC1 induction, and inhibition of MPC induction coincided with a reduced rise in blood glucose. cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) knockdown blocked glucagon-induced MPC1 expression, while CREB overexpression increased MPC1 expression. Luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and promoter mutation confirmed that CREB increased MPC1 transcription through gene promoter induction. CREB regulated transcription co-activator 2 nuclear translocation was also required for CREB to promote MPC1 induction. Glucagon shifted mitochondrial pyruvate towards carboxylation for gluconeogenesis via the opposite regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and carboxylase with respect to MPC1 induction. MPC1 induction was necessary for glucagon to promote pyruvate-driven hepatic glucose production (HGP), but glucagon failed to influence HGP from other gluconeogenic substrates routed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, independent of MPC. Rb1 blocked cAMP signalling by inhibiting AC activity and deactivated CREB by dephosphorylation, possibly contributing to inhibiting MPC1 induction to reduce HGP. CREB transcriptionally up-regulates MPC1 to provide pyruvate for gluconeogenesis. Rb1 reduced cAMP formation which consequently reduced CREB-mediated MPC1 induction and thereby might contribute to limiting pyruvate-dependent HGP. These results suggest a therapeutic strategy to reduce hyperglycaemia in diabetes.","2019"

This single-blind randomized clinical trial was carried out on 60 infertile participants with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) willing to be pregnant. They were randomly allocated into group 1 (n = 20) who received routine dose of CC pills (50-150 mg) for three menstrual cycles from the fifth day of menstruation for five days; group 2 (n = 20) who consumed herbal mixture daily (700 mg); and group 3 (n = 20) who used up herbal mixture along with CC for 3 months. Catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured in their blood samples. No statistically significant differences were observed between the three groups in terms of socio-demographic characteristics. After intervention, however, the levels of CAT in group 2 (adjusted mean difference (aMD): = 9.0; confidence interval (CI) 95% = 1.1-16.9) and group 3 (aMD = 12.2; CI 95% = 4.5-19.9), GPx in group 2 (aMD = 986.1; CI 95% = 141.1-1831.1) and group 3 (aMD = 1781.2; CI 95% = 960.7-2601.8), and SOD in group 2 (aMD = 55.1; CI 95% = 26.0-84.2) increased. While FBS in group 3 (aMD = -8.7; CI 95% = -14.7 to -2.7), insulin in group 2 (aMD = -5.6; CI 95% = -10.8 to -0.4), and HOMA-IR in group 2 (aMD = -1.3; CI 95% = -2.4 to -0.2) significantly decreased compared to the group 1.

Thirty healthy young adult males (15 obese, 15 lean) ate a standardised meal, then performed HIE (4 × 30-s Wingate cycling/4-min rest) or a no-exercise control trial (CON). Blood glucose was measured preprandially and up to 150 min postprandially. Compared to CON, HIE reduced postprandial glucose concentrations at 120-150 min in obese (p < 0.001) and lean men (p < 0.05), with greater reductions in obese than lean subjects at 120 (-27.0% vs. -8.3%), 135 (-31.9% vs. -15.7%), and 150 min (-21.8% vs. -10.6%). The total glucose area under the curve (AUC) for the testing period was lower with HIE than CON among obese men (p < 0.05), but not lean men (p > 0.05). We found moderate correlations between body mass and postprandial glucose changes (r = 0.39-0.44, p < 0.05), and between glucose AUC and body mass and fat free mass (r = 0.39-0.48, p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that HIE may act as a time-efficient lifestyle intervention strategy for improving obesity-related diabetes risk factors, and might play a role in primary diabetes prevention for the healthy but sedentary population.","2019"

The present study aimed to evaluate the metabolic effects of LBP on the urine and liver metabolomics on a high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model. After 8 weeks of high-fat diet and streptozotocin induction of diabetes, 24 diabetic rats were randomly allocated to the diabetic control (DC) group, LBP low, moderate, and high dosage (LBP-L, LBP-M, LBP-H) groups and 6 non-diabetic rats were established as the non-diabetic control (NDC) group for 30 days' intervention. Metabolomics was performed on liver and urine. LBP positively regulated fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin-A1c, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, liver glycogen and SOD levels significantly, as compared to the DC group. Liver metabolomics showed higher levels of myo-inositol and lower levels of L-malic acid, fumaric acid, D-arabitol, L-allothreonine 1, xylitol, O-phosphorylethanolamine, ribitol, 5-methoxytryptamine 2 and digitoxose 2 in the LBP-H group vs. the DC group, which indicates that LBP may regulate the citrate cycle, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. Urine metabolomics showed increased levels of creatinine, D-galacturonic acid 2, 2,3-dihydroxybutyric acid and citric acid, and decreased levels of methylmalonic acid, benzoic acid and xylitol between the LBP-H and DC groups.

We assessed the quality of systematic reviews with the AMSTAR tool, and reported the outcomes with regard to: fertility (live birth, clinical pregnancy, ovulation and menstrual cycle regularization); endocrine outcomes (Ferriman-Gallwey score, free androgen index, free testosterone and total testosterone levels); and glycaemic (fasting blood insulin, fasting blood glucose, homoeostatic model assessment) and weight-related (BMI) outcomes. We assessed the strength of evidence for significant outcomes as per the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) system. We found twelve eligible systematic reviews which included between three (143 women) and 27 randomized trials (2093 women). Four reviews assessed the effects of lifestyle interventions (diet, physical activity and/or behavioural interventions); four evaluated nutritional supplements (one each on n-acetylcysteine, omega-3 fatty acids, inositol and vitamin D); and four studied alternative medical therapies (Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture). All of the included reviews were of high quality and scored between 8 and 11 with the AMSTAR tool (with a maximum score of 11).Randomized evidence is lacking for live birth rate. N-acetylcysteine, inositol and the addition of alternative medicine to ovulation induction agents show preliminary potential to improve fertility (odds ratios (OR) for clinical pregnancy rate range from 1.99 to 4.83). Lifestyle interventions show benefits in improving hirsutism (mean difference (MD): -1.01 to -1.19). Lifestyle interventions (MD: -1.10 to -2.02), inositol (MD: -2.1) and acupuncture (MD: -1.90 to -3.43) all show some evidence of improvement in glycaemic outcomes and there is some evidence of reduced BMI with lifestyle interventions (MD: -0.15 to -1.12). All of these outcomes scored either low or very low quality of evidence on the GRADE score. Lifestyle interventions in women with PCOS appear to improve glycaemic results, androgenic symptoms and anthropometric outcomes. The role of inositol and N-acetylcysteine in women with PCOS needs further evaluation. Large primary trials on all interventions are needed for an agreed set of core outcomes.","2019"

The aim of this article was to evaluate the effects of cycle and treadmill desks on energy expenditure and cardiovascular and biochemical indicators in sedentary workers. Materials and methods. In February 2018, six databases were searched. Both parallel and crossover design studies evaluating workplace cycle and treadmill desks compared to a conventional seated condition were included. Results. Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Cycle and treadmill desks significantly increased energy expenditure (standard mean difference [SMD] = 3.84, p < 0.001, I2 = 95%) and the heart rate (SMD = 1.68, p < 0.001, I2 = 91%), and lowered blood glucose and insulin levels (SMD = -0.54, p < 0.001, I2 = 0% and SMD = -3.13, p < 0.001, I2 = 76%, respectively). The interventions had no effect on blood pressure and other biochemical indicators. Conclusion. Cycle and treadmill desks may positively influence energy expenditure in sedentary workers and could be effective for reducing negative effects of workplace-related sedentary behaviour. However, considerable heterogeneity is present in the measuring protocols for energy expenditure.","2021"

Forty-two overweight women (age 21.2 ± 1.4 years, BMI 26.3 ± 2.5 kg·m-2) were randomized to the groups of SIT (80 × 6-s sprints + 9-s rest), and isoenergetic (300KJ) HIIT (~9 × 4-min cycling at 90% V̇O2peak + 3-min rest) and MICT (cycling at 60% V̇O2peak for ~ 61-min). Training intervention was performed 3 d·week-1 for 12 weeks. After intervention, all three groups induced the same improvement in V̇O2peak (~ +25%, p < 0.001) and a similar reduction in body mass (~ - 5%, p < 0.001). Insulin sensitivity and fasting insulin levels were improved significantly on post-training measures in SIT and HIIT by ~26% and ~39% (p < 0.01), respectively, but remain unchanged in MICT. In contrast, fasting glucose levels were only reduced with MICT (p < 0.01). The three training strategies are equally effective in improving V̇O2peak and reducing body mass, however, the SIT is time-efficient. High-intensity training (i.e. SIT and HIIT) seems to be more beneficial than MICT in improving insulin sensitivity.

"30451115","Weijers Rob N M; Bekedam Dick J","The Metformin Paradox.","The Diabetes Prevention Program study results indicated that metformin therapy was not as beneficial as a lifestyle modification for delaying the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals at high risk of the disease. A key feature in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which appears in the prediabetic phase, is a significant deficiency, compared to healthy controls, in highly flexible poly-cis-unsaturated fatty acyl chains in membrane phospholipids. This deficiency lowers membrane flexibility, which in turn, reduces the amount of all functional Class I glucose transporters, and thereby reduces glucose-mediated ATP production. This leads to an increase in essentially saturated free fatty acid (FFA) levels for fatty-acid-mediated ATP production, which will set up a vicious cycle of raising the levels of essentially saturated FFAs and lowering the level of transmembrane glucose transport. Metformin suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis, which reduces the plasma glucose concentration. We hypothesize that chronic metformin treatment leads to an additional increase in essentially saturated FFAs, which causes an additional rise in membrane stiffness and hypoxia. So we propose that all these metformin-mediated activities accelerated the onset of type 2 diabetes in the participants of the metformin group in the Diabetes Prevention Program study, compared to the participants of the lifestyle-intervention group in this study. We propose that the biochemical reactions, involved in the fatty-acid-mediated ATP production, play an important part in the increase of the observed essentially saturated FFA concentrations. These statements should also extend to the metformin therapy of individuals with type 2 diabetes.","2020"

However, it is unknown whether transplanted islets regulate plasma glucose concentrations appropriately during and after exercise in human islet transplant recipient (ITxs). To determine the effect of exercise on plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon concentrations in ITxs compared with control subjects (CONs) without diabetes. Participants completed two conditions in random order: 45 minutes of aerobic exercise (60% VO2peak) and 45 minutes of seated rest. Blood samples were drawn at baseline, immediately after exercise or rest, and every 15 minutes throughout a 60-minute recovery period. Postexercise (24 hours) interstitial glucose was monitored with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Twenty-four participants (12 ITxs, 12 CONs) completed the protocol. Plasma glucose decreased more over time with exercise in ITxs compared with CONs [main effects of treatment (P = 0.019), time (P = 0.001), and group (P = 0.012)]. Plasma glucose was lower during exercise vs rest in ITxs but not CONs [treatment by group interaction (P = 0.028)]. Plasma glucose decreased more during exercise than during rest [treatment by time interaction (P = 0.001)]. One ITx and one CON experienced plasma glucose concentrations <3.5 mmol/L at the end of exercise, both of whom returned above that threshold within 15 minutes. Nocturnal CGM glucose <3.5 mmol/L was detected in two CONs but no ITxs. Despite a greater plasma glucose decline during exercise in ITxs, hypoglycemia risk was similar during and after exercise in ITxs compared with CONs.","2019"

To maximize its use for clinical management, the most effective modality should be identified. The purpose of this review is to elucidate the most effective modality of exercise on insulin sensitivity and blood glucose control in pregnant women with or at risk of GDM. A search was undertaken in MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Embase and the Maternity & Infant Healthcare Database. Studies that met inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials and case-controlled studies, which compared exercise interventions with standard care during pregnancy in women with or at risk of GDM. Two interventions using resistance training, eight using aerobic exercise and two using a combination of both modalities were included. The interventions showed consistently that requirements of insulin therapy, dosage, and latency to administration were improved in the exercise groups. Less consistent results were observed for capillary blood glucose measurements; however, both modalities and combination of modalities were effective at improving blood glucose control in already diagnosed patients and pregnant women with obesity. Discrepancies in the timing of intervention, GDM diagnostic criteria, and the different measures used to assess glucose metabolism make it difficult to draw clear recommendations. Exercising three times per week for 40-60 min at 65-75% age-predicted heart rate maximum using cycling, walking or circuit training as a modality improved glycaemic control in GDM patients and reduced incidence of GDM in pregnant women with obesity. Further studies looking specifically at the effects of different modalities of exercise on glucose metabolism with combined strategies to enhance insulin sensitivity should be explored to maximize benefits for GDM pregnancies. Consistency in design and delivery of exercise-only interventions is required to make recommendations on a suitable exercise prescription in this population. In practice, adherence to consensus in diagnostic cut-offs for GDM diagnosis is fundamental for standardizing future research.","2018"

Studies in mice suggest that the AMPK-TBC1D4 signalling axis is important for the increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake after a single bout of exercise. The present study is the first longitudinal intervention study to show that, although exercise training increases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle at rest, it diminishes the ability of a single bout of exercise to enhance muscle insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. The present study provides novel data indicating that AMPK in human skeletal muscle is important for the insulin-sensitizing effect of a single bout of exercise. Not only chronic exercise training, but also a single bout of exercise, increases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. However, it is not well described how adaptations to exercise training affect the ability of a single bout of exercise to increase insulin sensitivity. Rodent studies suggest that the insulin-sensitizing effect of a single bout of exercise is AMPK-dependent (presumably via the α2 β2 γ3 AMPK complex). Whether this is also the case in humans is unknown. Previous studies have shown that exercise training decreases the expression of the α2 β2 γ3 AMPK complex and diminishes the activation of this complex during exercise. Thus, we hypothesized that exercise training diminishes the ability of a single bout of exercise to enhance muscle insulin sensitivity. We investigated nine healthy male subjects who performed one-legged knee-extensor exercise at the same relative intensity before and after 12 weeks of exercise training. Training increased V̇O2peak and expression of mitochondrial proteins in muscle, whereas the expression of AMPKγ3 was decreased. Training also increased whole body and muscle insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the acutely exercised leg was not enhanced further by training. Thus, the increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake following a single bout of one-legged exercise was lower in the trained vs. untrained state. This was associated with reduced signalling via confirmed α2 β2 γ3 AMPK downstream targets (ACC and TBC1D4). These results suggest that the insulin-sensitizing effect of a single bout of exercise is also AMPK-dependent in human skeletal muscle.","2019"

Although Allicin, an active ingredient of garlic has been extensively studied on carcinogen-induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in rats (Rattus norvegicus), no systematic study on the beneficial effects of generic aged garlic and specific aged garlic extract-Kyolic has been done. The present study involves rats fed chronically with two liver carcinogens, p-dimethylaminoazobenzene and phenobarbital, to produce hepatotoxicity. The aged garlic extract was characterized by UV-spectra, FTIR, HPLC and GC-MS. Biochemical and pathophysiological tests were performed by keeping suitable controls at four fixation intervals, namely, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days, utilizing several widely accepted toxicity biomarkers. Compared to the controls, remarkable elevation in the activities of lactate dehydrogenase, gamma glutamyl transferase and decline in catalase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were observed in the carcinogen fed rats. Daily administration of aged garlic extract, could favorably modulate the elevated levels of various toxicity biomarkers including serum triglyceride, creatinine, urea, bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen except total cholesterol. It also altered the levels of blood glucose, HDL-cholesterol, albumin, AST, ALT, and hemoglobin contents in carcinogen intoxicated rats, indicating its protective potential against hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in the experimental rats. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 and p53 proteins caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in garlic fed group. Kyolic exhibited additional benefits by arresting cell viability of cancer cells. This study would thus validate the use of aged garlic extract in the treatment of diseases causing liver toxicity including hepatocarcinoma.","2020"

No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and baseline values. 3 months after the intervention, based on the ANCOVA and after adjusting for the baseline values, the mean serum levels of LDL-C (adjusted mean difference = - 29.79; 95% CI = - 43.37 to - 16.21; P < 0.001), triglyceride (AMD = - 38.50; 95% CI = - 59.73 to - 17.28; P = 0.001), total cholesterol (AMD = - 29.98; 95% CI = - 40.14 to - 19.82; P < 0.001), FBS (AMD = - 11.24; 95% CI = - 15.43 to - 7.06; P < 0.001), hsCRP (AMD = - 1.75; 95% CI = - 2.92 to - 0.57; P = 0.004), DHEA-S (AMD = - 0.7; 95% CI = - 1.34 to - 0.13; P = 0.017) and free testosterone (AMD = - 0.32; 95% CI = - 0.56 to - 0.08; P = 0.010) revealed a statistically significant decrease in the intervention group compared to the placebo group, while the mean serum HDL-C showed a statistically significant increase in this group compared to the placebo group (AMD = 5.82; 95% CI = 2.27-9.37; P = 0.002). 3 months after the intervention, there was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of menstrual cycle intervals and hirsutism (P < 0.001). Resistant dextrin consumption can regulate metabolic parameters and androgen levels and manifestations including hirsutism and menstrual cycle irregularity in women with PCOS.","2019"

Intervention at various stages of the life cycle is needed as cumulative effect of risk factors accumulated from fetal life to adult increases risk of noncommunicable disease. The aim of this study was to find out awareness regarding T2DM and distribution of risk factor for T2DM in adolescents from the rural areas of Wardha district, India. A cross-sectional study conducted in the rural area of India involves 412 adolescent boys and girls selected by systematic random sampling technique. Data collected by a face-to-face interview and waist-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index, random capillary blood glucose (RCBG) were estimated. 65.1% were aware of T2DM. Girls, older adolescents, higher education were associated with awareness (P < 0.001). Totally, 204 (49.51%) had some risk factors for T2DM, of these 191 (46.6%) had sedentary lifestyle, 153 (31.7%) adolescents had nutritional risk factors, 69 (43.4%) boys had WHR >0.90 and 113 (71.1%) girls had WHR >0.85, 103 (25%) adolescents had RCBG ≥110 mg/dl, and 77 (18.7%) participants reported family history of DM. Considering the risk factors of T2DM among adolescents from the rural area, there is a need for prevention programs for creating awareness related to T2DM, early identification of risk factor for T2DM, and targeted interventions. The study may serve as a formative research for developing and testing interventions aimed at primary prevention of T2DM among adolescents from rural India.","2017"
"29369529","Bloomgarden Zachary","Diabetes and branched-chain amino acids: What is the link?","Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have increasingly been studied as playing a role in diabetes, with the PubMed search string ""diabetes"" AND ""branched chain amino acids"" showing particular growth in studies of the topic over the past decade (Fig. ). In the Young Finn's Study, BCAA and, to a lesser extent, the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine were associated with insulin resistance (IR) in men but not in women, whereas the gluconeogenic amino acids alanine, glutamine, or glycine, and several other amino acids (i.e. histidine, arginine, and tryptophan) did not show an association with IR. Obesity may track more strongly than metabolic syndrome and diabetes with elevated BCAA. In a study of 1302 people aged 40-79; higher levels of BCAA tracked with older age, male sex, and metabolic syndrome, as well as with obesity, cardiovascular risk, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and uric acid. Medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines, by-products of mitochondrial catabolism of BCAAs, as well as branched-chain keto acids and the BCAA themselves distinguished obese people having versus not having features of IR, and in a study of 898 patients with essential hypertension, the BCAA and tyrosine and phenylalanine were associated with metabolic syndrome and impaired fasting glucose. In a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies, elevations in BCAA and, to a lesser extent, in alanine tracked with IR, whereas higher levels of glutamine and glycine were associated with lesser likelihood of IR. Given these associations with IR, it is not surprising that a number of studies have shown higher BCAA levels in people with and prior to development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), although this has particularly been shown in Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups while not appearing to occur in African Americans. Similarly, higher BCAA levels track with cardiovascular disease. [Figure: see text] The metabolism of BCAA involves two processes: (i) a reversible process catalysed by a branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT), either cytosolic or mitochondrial, requiring pyridoxal to function as an amino group carrier, by which the BCAA with 2-ketoglutarate produce a branched-chain keto acid plus glutamate; and (ii) the irreversible mitochondrial process catalysed by branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) leading to formation of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA from leucine, valine, and isoleucine, respectively, which enter the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle as acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively, leading to ATP formation. The BCAA stimulate secretion of both insulin and glucagon and, when given orally, of both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), with oral administration leading to greater and more prolonged insulin and glucagon secretion. Insulin may particularly reduce BCAA turnover to a greater extent than that of other amino acids, and decreases the appearance and increases the uptake of amino acids. However, older studies of the effect of glucose or insulin on BCAA concentrations and rates of leucine appearance and oxidation showed no reduction in T2D, although the higher baseline levels of BCAA in obesity have long been recognized. Impaired function of BCAT and BCKDH has been posited, either as a primary genetic abnormality or due to effects of elevated fatty acids, proinflammatory cytokines, or insulin levels with consequent accumulation of branched-chain keto acids and metabolites such as diacylglycerol and ceramide, potentially contributing to the development of further insulin resistance, and decreased skeletal muscle BCAT and BCKDH expression has been shown in people with diabetes, supporting this concept. A Mendelian randomization study used measured variation in genes involved in BCAA metabolism to test the hypothesis of a causal effect of modifiable exposure on IR, showing that variants in protein phosphatase, Mg2+ /Mn2+ dependent 1K (PPM1K), a gene encoding the mitochondrial phosphatase activating the BCKDH complex, are associated with T2D, but another such study suggested that genetic variations associated with IR are causally related to higher BCAA levels. Another hypothesis involves the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is activated by BCAA, as well as by insulin and glucose via cellular ATP availability. If this is the relevant pathway, BCAA overload may cause insulin resistance by activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as by leading to increases in acylcarnitines, with mTOR seen in this scenario as a central signal of cross-talk between the BCAA and insulin. At this point, whether whole-body or tissue-specific BCAA metabolism is increased or decreased in states of insulin-resistant obesity and T2D is uncertain. Insulin action in the hypothalamus induces but overfeeding decreases hepatic BCKDH, leading to the concept that hypothalamic insulin resistance impairs BCAA metabolism in obesity and diabetes, so that plasma BCAAs may be markers of hypothalamic insulin action rather than direct mediators of changes in IR. A way to address this may be to understand the effects of changes in diet and other interventions on BCAA, as well as on IR and T2D. In an animal model, lowering dietary BCAA increased energy expenditure and improved insulin sensitivity. Two large human population studies showed an association of estimated dietary BCAA intake with T2D risk, although another population study showed higher dietary BCAA to be associated with lower T2D risk. Ethnic differences, reflecting underlying differences in genetic variants, may be responsible for such differences. In the study of Asghari et al. in the current issue of the Journal of Diabetes, BCAA intake was associated with the development of subsequent IR. Studies of bariatric surgery suggest lower basal and post-insulin infusion BCAA levels are associated with greater insulin sensitivity, with reductions in BCAA not seen with weight loss per se with gastric band procedures, but occurring after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, an intervention that may have metabolic benefits over and above those from reduction in body weight. The gut microbiota may be important for the supply of the BCAA to mammalian hosts, either by de novo biosynthesis or by modifying nutrient absorption. A final fascinating preliminary set of observations is that of the effects of empagliflozin on metabolomics; evidence of increased Krebs cycle activation and of higher levels of BCAA metabolites, such as acylcarnitines, suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition may, to some extent, involve BCAA metabolism. Certainly, we do not yet have a full understanding of these complex associations. However, the suggestion of multiple roles of BCAA in the development of IR promises to be important and to lead to the development of novel effective T2D therapies.","2018"

"29191090","Moghadam Alexander A; Moran Timothy H; Dailey Megan J","Alterations in circadian and meal-induced gut peptide levels in lean and obese rats.","Alterations in gut hormone signaling are a likely contributing factor to the metabolic disturbances associated with overweight/obesity as they coordinate the timing of feeding behavior, absorption, and utilization of nutrients. These hormones are released in response to food intake, or follow a circadian or anticipatory pattern of secretion that is independent of nutrient stimulation. The aim of this study was to identify the degree to which high-fat diet-induced obesity would alter the daily rhythm of gut peptide plasma levels (glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1], peptide YY [PYY], insulin or amylin [AMY]) or meal-induced levels in the middle of the light or dark cycle. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet (OBESE) or chow (LEAN), implanted with jugular catheters, and blood samples were taken every 2 h throughout the light/dark cycle while freely feeding or after an Ensure liquid meal. We found that even when OBESE and LEAN animals ate the same kcals and have a similar pattern of food intake, there is a difference in both the levels and rhythm of plasma gut peptides. GLP-1 and PYY are higher during the light cycle in LEAN animals and AMY is higher in the OBESE group throughout the light/dark cycle. There was also a differential response of plasma gut signals after the Ensure meal, even though the composition and amount of intake of the meal were the same in both groups. These changes occur prior to the high-fat diet induced loss of glycemic control and may be a target for early intervention. Impact statement The aim of this study was to test if obesity would alter the daily rhythm of gut peptides or meal-induced levels in the middle of the light or dark cycle. We found that even when animals are eating the same amount (in kcal) of food that the obese animals have altered daily rhythms and meal-induced gut peptide levels. In particular, we are the first to show that obesity induces increases in peptide YY levels during the light cycle and amylin remains high throughout the light and dark cycle in obese animals. These changes occurred prior to a loss of glycemic control. Thus, the rhythm of gut peptides could be used as an early indicator of later and more serious metabolic disturbances and may be a target for early intervention.","2017"

Eight men with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 8 healthy men (CON) matched for age, anthropometry, and peak pulmonary O2 uptake, completed a 1-year individualized training intervention in an unsupervised real-world setting. Before and after the intervention, the subjects performed a maximal incremental cycling test, during which alveolar gas exchange (volume turbine and mass spectrometry) and relative concentration changes in active leg muscle deoxygenated (Δ[HHb]) and total (Δ[tHb]) hemoglobin (near-infrared spectroscopy) were monitored. Peak O2 pulse, reflecting peak stroke volume, was calculated (peak pulmonary O2 uptake/peak heart rate). Glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) was evaluated. Both T1D and CON averagely performed 1 resistance-training and 3-4 endurance-training sessions per week (∼1 h/session at ∼moderate intensity). Training increased peak pulmonary O2 uptake in T1D (p = 0.004) and CON (p = 0.045) (group × time p = 0.677). Peak O2 pulse also rose in T1D (p = 0.032) and CON (p = 0.018) (group × time p = 0.880). Training increased leg Δ[HHb] at peak exercise in CON (p = 0.039) but not in T1D (group × time p = 0.052), while no changes in leg Δ[tHb] at any work rate were observed in either group (p > 0.05). HbA1c retained unchanged in T1D (from 58 ± 10 to 59 ± 11 mmol/mol, p = 0.609). In conclusion, 1-year adherence to exercise training enhanced cardiorespiratory fitness similarly in T1D and CON but had no effect on active muscle deoxygenation or glycemic control in T1D.","2018"

Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, which activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and increases cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production by promoting influx of pyruvate into the Krebs cycle. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on post-resuscitation neurological injury in an asphyxial cardiac arrest rat model. Asphyxial cardiac arrest was established by endotracheal tube clamping. A total of 111 rats were randomized into three groups: Sham group, Control group, and DCA intervention group. Animals in DCA intervention group were intraperitoneally administered DCA with a loading dose of 80 mg/kg at 15 min after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), whereas rats in the Control group received equivalent volume of saline. DCA treatment increased 3-day survival time, and reduced neurologic deficit scores at 24, 48, and 72 h after ROSC. It also attenuated cellular apoptosis and neuronal damage in the hippocampal cornuammonis one region by hematoxylin-eosin staining and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. In addition, DCA reduced the messenger RNA expression of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β in brain hippocampus and cortex after ROSC. Furthermore, DCA treatment significantly increased ATP production, PDH activity, and decreased blood glucose, lactate, and brain pyruvate levels after ROSC. Our results suggested that DCA has neuroprotective effects on brain injury after cardiac arrest, and its salutary effects were associated with an increase of mitochondrial energy metabolism in the brain through activation of PDH activity.","2018"

Changes in S G, but not in S I, were associated with changes in mean (β = -0.62 ± 0.23, r 2 = 0.17, p < 0.01) and maximum (β = -1.18 ± 0.52, r 2 = 0.12, p < 0.05) glucose levels during 24 h continuous glucose monitoring. Two weeks of IWT, but not CWT, improves S G but not S I in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, changes in S G are associated with changes in glycaemic control. Therefore, increased S G is likely an important mechanism by which training improves glycaemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Mouse models of FGR were established by low protein diet feeding of the pregnant mice. Both the newborn female mice with FGR and normal control (NC) mice were randomized for feeding with a standard diet (SF) or a high-fat diet (HF) after weaning and treatment with gavage of either metformin or normal saline. The mice were examined for vaginal opening time and the estrous cycle at the age of 8 weeks. At the age of 12 weeks, 6 mice in anestrus from each group were fasted for 12 h for measurement of body weight, height, poundera index (PI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (Fins), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), and the HOMA-IR was calculated. The reproductive capacity of female mice was assessed by mixing them with male mice at the ratio of 2:1. The 3 × 2 factorial analysis was conducted to determine the interactions between FGR, high-fat feeding and metformin. Factorial analysis showed that FGR and high-fat feeding had significant effects on the PI index, Fins, HOMA-IR, vaginal opening time, and AMH (P<0.05). Metformin significantly affected the factors related to high-fat feeding including weight, PI, FPG, Fins, HOMA-IR and estrous cycle (P<0.05) and the factors related to FGR with the exception of height and FSH (P<0.05). FGR significantly affected the factors tested except for body weight (P<0.05); high-fat feeding affected all the factors but the FSH (P<0.05); metformin affected all the factors but the height and FSH (P<0.05). In the female mice treated with saline, the pregnancy rates differed significantly between FGR mice with high-fat feeding and control mice with standard feeding, and between FGR mice with standard feeding and high-fat feeding (P<0.05). FGR mice can present with delayed puberty with rare ovulation and adulthood insulin resistance, and high-fat feeding after birth can promote the catch-up growth of FGR mice. Metformin intervention is effective for improving insulin resistance and reproductive-endocrine disorders in FGR mice during catch-up growth.","2017"

A multidisciplinary team managed a 3-week residential programme characterised by the integration of nutritional and physical rehabilitation with psychological and educational intervention. All patients consecutively admitted in 10 months were analysed at admission and discharge for changes in the following domains: anthropometry (weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and neck circumferences), cardiovascular risk factors (glycaemia, HbA1c, lipid profile, blood pressure), quality of life, eating behaviour, and physical performance (VO2peak by incremental cycle ergometer test, 6-min walking test (6MWT), chair stands test). 136 subjects (61% females, median age 52.7 years) with obesity (mean BMI 43.2 kg/m2) and multiple comorbidities were analysed. A 3.9% BMI reduction and a reduction in waist (-3.8%) and neck (-3.3%) circumferences were observed. Glycaemic control was achieved in 68% of patients with uncontrolled diabetes at admission. Blood pressure control was achieved in all patients with uncontrolled hypertension at admission. Total cholesterol (-16%), LDL-cholesterol (-19%) and triglycerides (-9%) were significantly reduced. Psychometric assessment showed improvements in quality of life perception and binge eating disorder. Finally, a significant improvement in physical performance (+4.7% improvement in VO2peak, with longer distances in 6MWT and a higher number of standings) was observed. Our preliminary data prove that a 3-week programme determined a clinically significant multi-dimensional improvement in patients with severe obesity. Long-term follow-up data are needed to confirm the efficacy of our rehabilitation setting.","2017"

Nineteen nondiabetic males (age: 23.3 ± 0.7 yrs; height: 173.1 ± 1.2 cm; weight: 79.1 ± 4.8 kg; % fat: 22.5 ± 2.5%) were studied. RES involved nine exercises of 10 repetitions at 75% 1-RM using a 2 : 2 s tempo and was interspersed with a one-minute recovery; SIE involved four 30 s' all-out cycling effort interspersed with four minutes of active recovery. Plasma glucose and insulin in response to a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test were assessed 12 h after exercise. In comparison to a no exercise control trial (CON), the area under curve (AUC) of plasma glucose was reduced with both RES and SIE (P < 0.05), while insulin AUC was only reduced with RES. Cederholm, Gutt, Matsuda, and HOMA indices were improved (P < 0.05) following RES compared to CON. Corresponding changes following SIE were only found in Cederholm and Gutt indices (P < 0.05). No difference was found in plasma variables and indices between RES and SIE (P > 0.05). Such findings suggest that the RES may represent a potential alternative to the SIE in the development of time-efficient lifestyle intervention strategies for improving diabetes risk factors in healthy populations.","2017"

However, AIT has not been shown to reverse all metabolic syndrome risk factors, possibly due to the limited duration of the training programs. Thus, we assessed the effects of 6 months of AIT on cardio-metabolic health and muscle metabolism in middle-aged MetS. Eleven MetS (54.5±0.7 years old) underwent 6 months of 3 days a week supervised AIT program on a cycle ergometer. Cardio-metabolic health was assessed, and muscle biopsies were collected from the vastus lateralis prior and at the end of the program. Body fat mass (-3.8%), waist circumference (-1.8%), systolic (-10.1%), and diastolic (-9.3%) blood pressure were reduced, whereas maximal fat oxidation rate and VO2peak were significantly increased (38.9% and 8.0%, respectively; all P<.05). The remaining components of cardio-metabolic health measured (body weight, blood cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose) were not changed after the intervention, and likewise, insulin sensitivity (CSi) remained unchanged. Total AMPK (23.4%), GLUT4 (20.5%), endothelial lipase (33.3%) protein expression, and citrate synthase activity (26.0%) increased with training (P<.05). Six months of AIT in MetS raises capacity for fat oxidation during exercise and increases VO2peak in combination with skeletal muscle improvements in mitochondrial enzyme activity. Muscle proteins involved in glucose, fat metabolism, and energy cell balance improved, although this was not reflected by parallel improvements in insulin sensitivity or blood lipid profile.","2018"

Recently, it has been suggested that heat may augment the negative effect of mental fatigue on cognitive performance, raising the question whether it may also amplify the effect of mental fatigue on TT performance. In 30°C and 30% relative humidity, 10 endurance-trained male athletes (mean ± SD; age = 22 ± 3 yr, Wmax = 332 ± 41 W) completed two experimental conditions: intervention (I; 45-min Stroop task) and control (C; 45-min documentary). Pre- and postintervention/control, cognitive performance was followed up with a 5-min Flanker task. Thereafter, subjects cycled for 45 min at a fixed pace equal to 60% Wmax, immediately followed by a self-paced TT in which they had to produce a fixed amount of work (equal to cycling 15 min at 80% Wmax) as fast as possible. Self-reported mental fatigue was significantly higher after I compared with C (P < 0.05). Moreover EEG measures also indicated the occurrence of mental fatigue during the Stroop (P < 0.05). TT did not differ between conditions (I = 906 ± 30 s, C = 916 ± 29 s). Throughout exercise, physiological (HR, blood lactate, core, and skin temperature) and perceptual measures (perception of effort and thermal sensation) were not affected by mental fatigue. No negative effects of mild mental fatigue were observed on performance and the physiological and perceptual responses to endurance exercise in the heat. Most plausibly, mild mental fatigue does not reduce endurance performance when the brain is already stressed by a hot environment.","2017"

But there is still no randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of acupuncture on the insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS and IR. In this article, we present the protocol of a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of true acupuncture on the insulin sensitivity of these patients compared with metformin and sham acupuncture. Acupuncture may be an effective therapeutic alternative that is superior to metformin and sham acupuncture in improving the insulin sensitivity of PCOS combined with IR. This study is a multi-center, controlled, double-blind, and randomized clinical trial aiming to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on the insulin sensitivity in PCOS combined with IR. In total 342 patients diagnosed with PCOS and IR will be enrolled. Participants will be randomized to one of the three groups: (1) true acupuncture + metformin placebo; (2) sham acupuncture + metformin, and (3) sham acupuncture + metformin placebo. Participants and assessors will be blinded. The acupuncture intervention will be given 3 days per week for a total of 48 treatment sessions during 4 months. Metformin (0.5 g per pill) or placebo will be given, three times per day, and for 4 months. Primary outcome measures are changes in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and improvement rate of HOMA-IR by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin releasing test (Ins). Secondary outcome measures are homeostasis model assessment-β (HOMA-β), area under the curve for glucose and insulin, frequency of regular menstrual cycles and ovulation, body composition, metabolic profile, hormonal profile, questionnaires, side effect profile, and expectation and credibility of treatment. Outcome measures are collected at baseline, at the end of treatments, and 3 months after the last acupuncture treatment. On completion of the screening visit, randomization will be conducted using a central randomization system. This study will investigate the effects of acupuncture on the insulin sensitivity of PCOS and IR women compared with metformin and sham acupuncture. We will test whether true acupuncture with needles placed in skeletal muscles and stimulated manually and by electrical stimulation is more effective than metformin and sham acupuncture with superficial needle placement with no manual or electrical stimulation in improving the insulin sensitivity in PCOS women with IR.

The objective of this study was to test whether regular light postprandial physical activity can improve glycemia in persons with hyperglycemia or with a high risk of hyperglycemia. We randomized 56 participants to an intervention or a control group. They were diagnosed as hyperglycemic, not using antidiabetics, or were categorized as high-risk individuals for type 2 diabetes. The intervention group was instructed to undertake a minimum 30 min of daily light physical activity, starting a maximum of 30 min after a meal in addition to their usual physical activity for 12 weeks. The control group maintained their usual lifestyle. Blood samples were taken pre- and post-test. Forty participants completed the study and are included in the results. The self-reported increase in daily physical activity from before to within the study period was higher in the intervention group compared with control (41 ± 25 vs. 2 ± 16 min, p < 0.001). Activity diaries and accelerometer recordings supported this observation. The activity in the intervention group started earlier after the last meal compared with control (30 ± 13 vs. 100 ± 57 min, p = 0.001). There were no within- or between-group differences in any glycemic variable from pre- to post-test. In conclusion, the present study does not seem to support the notion that regular light postprandial physical activity improves blood glucose in the long term in persons with hyperglycemia or with high risk of hyperglycemia.","2017"

Most exercise interventions have targeted leisure time, but physical activity also takes place in other domains of everyday life. Active commuting represents a promising alternative to increase physical activity, but it has yet to be established whether active commuting conveys health benefits on par with leisure time physical activity (LTPA). A 6-month randomized controlled trial was designed to investigate the effects of increased physical activity in transport (bicycling) or leisure time domains (moderate or vigorous intensity endurance exercise). We included 188 overweight and class 1 obese sedentary women and men (20-45years) of which 130 were randomized to either sedentary controls (n=18), active commuting (n=35) or moderate (n=39) or vigorous (n=38) intensity LTPA.

In a sub-sample, physical activity level and energy expenditure were monitored by means of personal assistive technology and the doubly labeled water technique. Additionally, the delivery, reception and routinization of the exercise regimens were investigated by ethnological fieldwork. One year after termination of the intervention, participants will be invited for a follow-up visit to investigate sustained health effects and continuous physical activity adherence.

Estimates of the combined prevalence of intermediate hyperglycaemia and diabetes in Bangladesh vary, and can be as high as 30% of the adult population. Despite such high prevalence, awareness and control of diabetes and its risk factors are limited. Prevention and control of diabetes and its complications demand increased awareness and action of individuals and communities, with positive influences on behaviours and lifestyle choices. In this study, we will test the effect of two different interventions on diabetes occurrence and its risk factors in rural Bangladesh. A three-arm cluster randomised controlled trial of mobile health (mHealth) and participatory community group interventions will be conducted in four rural upazillas in Faridpur District, Bangladesh. Ninety-six clusters (villages) will be randomised to receive either the mHealth intervention or the participatory community group intervention, or be assigned to the control arm. In the mHealth arm, enrolled individuals will receive twice-weekly voice messages sent to their mobile phone about prevention and control of diabetes. In the participatory community group arm, facilitators will initiate a series of monthly group meetings for men and women, progressing through a Participatory Learning and Action cycle whereby group members and communities identify, prioritise and tackle problems associated with diabetes and the risk of developing diabetes. Both interventions will run for 18 months. The primary outcomes of the combined prevalence of intermediate hyperglycaemia and diabetes and the cumulative 2-year incidence of diabetes among individuals identified as having intermediate hyperglycaemia at baseline will be evaluated through baseline and endline sample surveys of permanent residents aged 30 years or older in each of the study clusters.

Nutritional strategies can be effective in enhancing recovery rate. Choosing the best food items in appropriate intervals can play effective roles in resynthesis of fuels and recovery of muscle injury. Beverage micro and macronutrient content are helpful in fuel restoration. In this study, we assess the effects of various kinds of beverages on oxidative stress, muscle injury, and metabolic risk factors in taekwondo players. This quasi-experimental study was performed on 21 taekwondo players of Isfahan. After collecting fasting blood, they performed runningbased anaerobic sprint test (RAST). Blood lactate was tested again and participants were divided into 3 intervention groups, that is, receiving 500 cc dough, non-alcoholic beer, and chocolate milk at 4 day intervals. After a 2-h recovery period, blood sampling was repeated. Elites consumed other beverages in later phases. Dietary intake and fasting triglyceride, cholesterol, blood sugar, lactate dehydrogenase, and F2-isoprostane concentrations were determined. Data were analyzed with a simple repeated-measures test and post-hoc tests using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. Data showed that cholesterol levels non-significantly decreased after intervention. Triglyceride level was lower after taking dough and carbohydrate replacement drink. Blood glucose concentration increased after intervention periods, however, this increase was significant only after non-alcoholic beverage consumption. Lactate dehydrogenase levels reduced after all cycles, however, F2-isoprostane level showed no significant change. There was not significant change in lactate dehydrogenase and F2-isoprostane levels. Non-alcoholic beer consumption can reduce lactate dehydrogenase concentration; however, it leads to blood sugar increase. Moreover, dough consumption significantly reduced triglyceride level in taekwondo players.","2016"

"27807523","Delvecchio Luke; Reaburn Peter; Trapp Gail; Korhonen Marko T","Effect of concurrent resistance and sprint training on body composition and cardiometabolic health indicators in masters cyclists.","In older previously sedentary individuals endurance training imposes a more effective stimulus to enhance cardiometabolic health compared with resistance or sprint training. We examined the effect of replacing a portion of endurance training with combined resistance and/or sprint training and how this influences cardiometabolic health indicators in masters endurance cyclists. Twenty-seven well-trained male road cyclists (53.7±8.2 years) were allocated to a resistance and track sprint-cycling training group (RTC, n=10), an endurance and track sprint-cycling group (ETC, n=7) or a control endurance group (CTRL, n=10). Both the RTC and ETC groups completed a 12-week intervention of specific training while the CTRL group maintained their endurance training load. Lower limb lean mass (LLM), trunk fat mass (TFM), fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured before and after the intervention period. TFM decreased for all groups (P<0.05) while LLM significantly increased for RTC and ETC groups (P<0.05). No significant between group or time effects were observed for FBG, TC, TG, SBP, or DBP. The results suggest that replacing a portion of endurance training with 12 weeks of ETC or RTC training favourably affects body composition by lowering TFM and increasing LLM without negatively affecting cardiometabolic health indicators in well-trained masters endurance cyclists.","2016"
"27774458","Kong Zhaowei; Sun Shengyan; Liu Min; Shi Qingde","Short-Term High-Intensity Interval Training on Body Composition and Blood Glucose in Overweight and Obese Young Women.","This study was to determine the effects of five-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, blood glucose, and relevant systemic hormones when compared to moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in overweight and obese young women. Methods. Eighteen subjects completed 20 sessions of HIIT or MICT for five weeks. HIIT involved 60 × 8 s cycling at ~90% of peak oxygen consumption ([Formula: see text]) interspersed with 12 s recovery, whereas MICT involved 40-minute continuous cycling at 65% of [Formula: see text]. [Formula: see text], body composition, blood glucose, and fasting serum hormones, including leptin, growth hormone, testosterone, cortisol, and fibroblast growth factor 21, were measured before and after training. Results. Both exercise groups achieved significant improvements in [Formula: see text] (+7.9% in HIIT versus +11.7% in MICT) and peak power output (+13.8% in HIIT versus +21.9% in MICT) despite no training effects on body composition or the relevant systemic hormones. Blood glucose tended to be decreased after the intervention (p = 0.062). The rating of perceived exertion in MICT was higher than that in HIIT (p = 0.042). Conclusion. Compared with MICT, short-term HIIT is more time-efficient and is perceived as being easier for improving cardiorespiratory fitness and fasting blood glucose for overweight and obese young women.","2016"
"27735783","Gorgey Ashraf S; Graham Zachary A; Bauman William A; Cardozo Christopher; Gater David R","Abundance in proteins expressed after functional electrical stimulation cycling or arm cycling ergometry training in persons with chronic spinal cord injury.","Longitudinal design. The study determined the effects of two forms of exercise training on the abundance of two proteins, (glucose transporter-4 [GLUT-4], adenosine monophosphate kinase [AMPK]) involved in glucose utilization and the transcriptional coactivator that regulates the genes involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) coactivator 1 alpha [PGC-1α]), in muscles in men with chronic motor-complete spinal cord injury (SCI). Clinical trial at a Medical Center. Nine men with chronic motor-complete SCI participated in functional electrical stimulation lower extremity cycling (FES-LEC; n = 4) or arm cycling ergometer (arm-cycling ergometer [ACE]; n = 5) 5 days/week for 16 weeks. Whole body composition was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. An intravenous glucose tolerance test was performed to measure glucose effectiveness (Sg) and insulin sensitivity (Si). Muscle biopsies of the right vastus lateralis (VL) and triceps muscles were collected one week prior to and post the exercise training intervention. Neither training intervention altered body composition or carbohydrate metabolism. GLUT-4 increased by 3.8 fold in the VL after FES training and increased 0.6 fold in the triceps after ACE training. PGC-1α increased by 2.3 fold in the VL after FES training and 3.8 fold in the triceps after ACE training. AMPK increased by 3.4 fold in the VL after FES training and in the triceps after ACE training. FES-LEC and ACE training were associated with greater protein expressions in the trained muscles by effectively influencing the abundance of GLUT-4, AMPK and PGC-1α. Thus, FES-LEC training of paralyzed muscle can modulate protein expression similar to that of trained and innervated muscle.","2017"
"27695119","Jakobsen Ida; Solomon Thomas P J; Karstoft Kristian","The Acute Effects of Interval-Type Exercise on Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes Subjects: Importance of Interval Length. A Controlled, Counterbalanced, Crossover Study.","Interval-type exercise is effective for improving glycemic control, but the optimal approach is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of the interval length on changes in postprandial glycemic control following a single exercise bout. Twelve subjects with type 2 diabetes completed a cross-over study with three 1-hour interventions performed in a non-randomized but counter-balanced order: 1) Interval walking consisting of repeated cycles of 3 min slow (aiming for 54% of Peak oxygen consumption rate [VO2peak]) and 3 min fast (aiming for 89% of VO2peak) walking (IW3); 2) Interval walking consisting of repeated cycles of 1 min slow and 1 min fast walking (IW1) and 3) No walking (CON). The exercise interventions were matched with regards to walking speed, and VO2 and heart rate was assessed throughout all interventions. A 4-hour liquid mixed meal tolerance test commenced 30 min after each intervention, with blood samples taken regularly. IW3 and IW1 resulted in comparable mean VO2 and heart rates. Overall mean postprandial blood glucose levels were lower after IW3 compared to CON (10.3±3.0 vs. 11.1±3.3 mmol/L; P < 0.05), with no significant differences between IW1 (10.5±2.8 mmol/L) and CON or IW3 and IW1 (P > 0.05 for both). Conversely blood glucose levels at specific time points during the MMTT differed significantly following both IW3 and IW1 as compared to CON. Our findings support the previously found blood glucose lowering effect of IW3 and suggest that reducing the interval length, while keeping the walking speed and time spend on fast and slow walking constant, does not result in additional improvements.

The daily duration of exercise was 10 h and 31 ± 37 min, and the mean intensity was 53% ± 1% of V˙O2max. Body weight remained unchanged. V˙O2max and maximal fat oxidation rate decreased by 6% ± 2% (P = 0.04) and 32% ± 8% (P < 0.01), respectively. The exercise intensity that elicits maximal fat oxidation was not significantly decreased. Plasma free fatty acid (FA) concentration decreased (P < 0.002) from 500 ± 77 μmol·L to 160 ± 38 μmol·L. Plasma glucose concentration as well as muscle glycogen, myoglobin, and triacylglycerol content remained unchanged. Muscle citrate synthase and ß-hydroxy-acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase activities were unchanged, but the protein expression of HKII, GLUT4, and adipose triacylglycerol lipase were significantly increased. Overall, the decreased maximal fat oxidation was probably due to lower exogenous plasma fatty acid availability and the muscle adaptation pattern indicates an increased glucose transport capacity and an increased muscle lipolysis capacity supporting an increased contribution of exogenous glucose and endogenous fat during exercise.","2017"

We designed an evidence-based golden hour protocol (GHP) with a goal to stabilize and perform admission procedures within 1 hour of birth at a level IIIB neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The aim of this quality improvement project was to ascertain whether an evidence-based GHP would improve care efficiency and short-term outcomes. Rapid cycles of change using Plan Do Study Act were utilized to document progress and gain knowledge during the quality improvement project. Measures were plotted with statistical process control methods (SPC), which analyzed improvement over time. Both admission temperature and glucose-level means were within reference range throughout the project and predicted a stable process. We observed significantly decreased time to initiation of intravenous fluids and antibiotics. An upward trend of surfactant administration within the first 2 hours of life was also observed. The use of a GHP provided an organized approach to admission procedures and care. By using a checklist and recording intervention times, NICU caregivers were more aware of time management for each intervention and were able to decrease time to initiation of intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Future research should focus on establishing normal blood pressure ranges and safe pain management during the ""golden hour"" and beyond. Future quality improvement should focus on improving subsequent temperature and blood glucose levels after admission umbilical artery and venous catheter placement.","2016"

Onion, a so-called functional food, is noted to affect the insulin signaling pathway of diabetes in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of consuming fresh yellow onions on insulin-related indices compared with a low-onion-containing diet among breast cancer (BC) patients treated with doxorubicin. This parallel-design, randomized, triple-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted on 56 eligible BC patients (aged 30-63 years), diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. Following their second cycle of chemotherapy, subjects were assigned in a stratified-random allocation to receive body mass index-dependent 100 to 160 g/d of onion as high onion group (HO; n = 28) or 30 to 40 g/d small onions in low onion group (LO; n = 28) for 8 weeks intervention. Participants, care givers, and those who assessed laboratory analyses were blinded to the assignments (IRCT Registry No.: IRCT2012103111335N1). The compliance level of participants in the analysis was as high as 87.85%. A total of 23 available cases was analyzed in each group. The daily use of HO resulted in a significant decrease in serum fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in comparison with LO, over the period of study ( P < .001). Posttreatment with HO showed a significant decrease in homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance relative to changes in the LO group ( P < .05). A comparison of the changes that occurred throughout pre- and postdose treatments indicated improved quantitative insulin sensitivity check index ( P < .05) and controls on C-peptide in the HO group ( P < .05). The present study demonstrated the effectiveness of onion to ameliorate hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in BC during doxorubicin-based chemotherapy.","2017"

Our purpose was to quantify usage patterns over 4 weeks of real-world commuting with a pedelec and to determine if pedelec use would improve cardiometabolic risk factors. Twenty sedentary commuters visited the laboratory for baseline physiological measurements [body composition, maximum oxygen consumption ([Formula: see text]), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), blood lipid profile, and 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)]. The following 4 weeks, participants were instructed to commute using a pedelec at least 3 days week(-1) for 40 min day(-1) while wearing a heart rate monitor and a GPS device. Metabolic equivalents (METS) were estimated from heart rate data. Following the intervention, we repeated the physiological measurements. Average total distance and time were 317.9 ± 113.8 km and 15.9 ± 3.4 h, respectively. Participants averaged 4.9 ± 1.2 METS when riding. Four weeks of pedelec commuting significantly improved 2-h post-OGTT glucose (5.53 ± 1.18-5.03 ± 0.91 mmol L(-1), p < 0.05), [Formula: see text] (2.21 ± 0.48-2.39 ± 0.52 L min(-1), p < 0.05), and end of [Formula: see text] test power output (165.1 ± 37.1-189.3 ± 38.2 W, p < 0.05).

The national guidelines regarding CT Head scans detail they should be completed within 12 hours of admission(1) and the trust guidelines, local to where this quality improvement project was based, advise a CT Head should be completed within four hours of admission.(2) The current national guidelines do not specify exact stroke blood tests, however trust guidelines give a specific set of blood tests that would be appropriate to be taken when a patient presents to A&E with a suspected stroke. These included FBC, U&E, blood glucose, ESR, cholesterol, TFTs, and coagulation screen.(2) The aim of this quality improvement project was to assess the timing of CT Head scans and blood tests and to implement a tool to ensure these are done in a timely fashion, within the emergency care setting. The project was completed through three PSDA cycles. The first was undertaken in an A&E department, which was soon to be closed and moved to a different site. The second cycle was then completed at the new site, to assess if there had been any change in timings of these interventions. In the previous site it was found that 97% of patients audited received a CT Head scan within four hours. At the new site it was found 94% patients received a CT Head within four hours, therefore both meeting trust targets on the whole. A full set of stroke blood tests were completed at the old site in 53% of patients and this decreased to 22% of patients at the new site. At this point it was decided an intervention should be implemented to ensure this did not continue. The intervention used was updating a stroke panel on the trust computer system (an easy to use, one-click button entitled ""Stroke/TIA"") with the correct blood tests and the use of this was promoted throughout the trust. A post-intervention audit was completed three months after the tool was promoted and patients receiving the correct blood tests whilst in the A&E department increased to 75%. The amount of patients receiving a CT Head scan within four hours was 100% therefore meeting both trust and national guidelines. In conclusion, the stroke blood panel appears to have improved the amount of patients receiving the correct blood tests when admitted with suspected stroke and will continue to stay in place at the trust.","2016"

This study investigated the effects of an educational program with emphasis on physical exercise on biological health markers of subjects with type 2 DM (T2DM). This was a quasi-experimental study with subjects who attended a diabetes education program over one year. At the beginning, middle and end of the annual cycle, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile and anthropometry were measured. The program offered two hours of educational and exercise interventions twice a week. Before and after each session capillary blood glucose (BG) was measured. Statistical analysis used Pearson's χ2, paired t, ANOVA-RM and MANOVA tests to compare results with significance levels set at P<0.05. Data of 103 subjects (73% women) were analyzed. Mean age was 64.1±10.8 years and 23% of participants were on insulin therapy. As an acute effect mean BG decreased significantly (P<0.001) from 157.5±61.5 mg/dL to 128.5±47.5 mg/dL after the intervention sessions, also resulting in increased prevalence of normoglycemic BG (from 44.0% to 68.6%). Chronic effects of participation in the program could be perceived through significant reduction (P<0.05) from beginning to end of the study of mean BG (from 144.8±5.0 mg/dL to 135.3±3.1 mg/dL), HbA1c (from 7.3±1.3% to 7.1±1.0%) and triglycerides (from 177.9±121.3 mg/dL to 150.5±130.9 mg/dL).

Sixteen elite athletes (8 male, 8 female, 24 ± 8 yrs) were randomly assigned into 2 training groups performing either 2 session per week of treadmill running or ergometer cycling in addition to 3 skating specific sessions (technique, plyometrics, parkour) for 8 weeks. Training intensity was determined within non-specific (cycling or running) and effects on specific endurance capacity within a specific incremental exercise test. Before and after the intervention all athletes performed a specific (300m) and one non-specific (30s cycling or 200m running) all-out sprint test according to the group affiliation. To determine the accumulation of blood lactate (BLa) and glucose (BGL) 20 μl arterialized blood was drawn at rest, as well as in 1 min intervals for 10 min after the sprint test. The sport-specific peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) was significantly increased (+17%; p = 0.01) in both groups and highly correlated with the sprint performance (r = -0.71). BLa values decreased significantly (-18%, p = 0.02) after the specific sprint test from pre to post-testing without any group effect. However, BGL values only showed a significant decrease (-2%, p = 0.04) in the running group. The close relationship between aerobic capacity and sprint performance in inline speed skating highlights the positive effects of endurance training. Although both training programs were equally effective in improving endurance and sprint capacities, the metabolic results indicate a faster recovery after high intensity efforts for all athletes, as well as a higher reliance on the fat metabolism for athletes who trained in the running group. Key pointsIn addition to a highly developed aerobic performance inline speed skaters also require a highly trained anaerobic capacity to be effective in the sprint sections such as the mass start, tactical attacks and finish line sprint.An 8-week low-intensity endurance training program of either cycling or running training combined with additional routine training improves classical aerobic characteristics (17% increase of VO2 peak), as well as values for acceleration and speed.Athletes who trained in the running group demonstrated a higher reliance on the fat metabolism in the sport-specific post-testing.The significant reduction in anaerobic ATP turnover during repeated sprints appears to be partially compensated by an increase in VO2 in subsequent sprint. The results revealed a close relationship between the aerobic capacity and sprint performance in inline speed skating.","2016"

This study assessed post-exercise glycaemic profiles of non-exercising individuals with insulin treated type 2 diabetes, following resistance and aerobic exercise. Randomised cross-over trial. Fourteen individuals with insulin treated type 2 diabetes (9 males, 5 females) aged 58.1±7.1 years (HbA1c: 8.0±0.6%) were allocated to single sessions of resistance (six whole-body exercises, three sets, 8-10 repetitions, 70% 1RM) and aerobic (30min cycling, 60% VO2peak) exercise, 7-days apart, with the day prior to the first exercise day of each intervention being the control condition. Immediately prior to exercise, insulin dosage was halved and breakfast consumed. Continuous glucose monitoring was undertaken to determine area under the curve and glucose excursions. Blood glucose initially increased (0-2h) following both resistance and aerobic exercise (p<0.001), peaking at 12.3±3.4mmolL(-1) and 12.3±3.3mmolL(-1), respectively. Area under the glucose curve was not statistically different over any of the 24h periods (p=0.12), or different in response to resistance (222±41mmolL(-1)24h(-1)) or aerobic (211±40 mmolL(-1)24h(-1)) exercise (p=0.56). Incidence of hyperglycaemia did not differ between exercise modes (p=0.68). Hypoglycaemic events were identified in three and four participants following resistance and aerobic exercise respectively: these did not require treatment. Glycaemic response is not different between exercise modes, although 50% insulin dose reduction prior to exercise impairs the expected improvement. A common clinical recommendation of 50% insulin dose reduction does not appear to cause adverse glycaemic events.","2016"

We compared plasma metabolites in T1D with poor (glycated hemoglobin ≥ 8.5%, T1D[-] and good (glycated hemoglobin < 6.5%, T1D[+]) glycemic control with nondiabetic controls (ND). The study was conducted at the clinical research unit. T1D with poor (n = 14), T1D(-) and good, T1D(+) (n = 15) glycemic control and matched (for age, sex, and body mass index) ND participants were included in the study. There were no intervention. Comparison of qualitative and quantitative profiling of metabolome was performed. In T1D(-), 347 known metabolites belonging to 38 metabolic pathways involved in cholesterol, vitamin D, tRNA, amino acids (AAs), bile acids, urea, tricarboxylic acid cycle, immune response, and eicosanoids were different from ND. In T1D(+),154 known metabolites belonging to 26 pathways including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, bile acids, tRNA biosynthesis, AAs, branch-chain AAs, retinol, and vitamin D metabolism remained altered from ND. Targeted measurements of AA metabolites, trichloroacetic acid, and free fatty acids showed directional changes similar to the untargeted metabolomics approach. Comprehensive metabolomic profiling identified extensive metabolomic abnormalities in T1D with poor glycemic control. Chronic good glycemic control failed to normalize many of these perturbations, suggesting a potential role for these persistent abnormalities in many complications in T1D.","2016"

The separate effects of the endogenous circadian system and circadian misalignment (ie, misalignment between the central circadian pacemaker and 24-hour environmental/behavioral rhythms such as the light/dark and feeding/fasting cycles) on glucose tolerance in shift workers are unknown. The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that the endogenous circadian system and circadian misalignment separately affect glucose tolerance in shift workers, both independently from behavioral cycle effects. A randomized, crossover study with two 3-day laboratory visits. Center for Clinical Investigation at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Healthy chronic shift workers. The intervention included simulated night work comprised of 12-hour inverted behavioral and environmental cycles (circadian misalignment) or simulated day work (circadian alignment). Postprandial glucose and insulin responses to identical meals given at 8:00 am and 8:00 pm in both protocols. Postprandial glucose was 6.5% higher at 8:00 pm than 8:00 am (circadian phase effect), independent of behavioral effects (P = .0041). Circadian misalignment increased postprandial glucose by 5.6%, independent of behavioral and circadian effects (P = .0042). These variations in glucose tolerance appeared to be explained, at least in part, by different insulin mechanisms: during the biological evening by decreased pancreatic β-cell function (18% lower early and late phase insulin; both P ≤ .011) and during circadian misalignment presumably by decreased insulin sensitivity (elevated postprandial glucose despite 10% higher late phase insulin; P = .015) without change in early-phase insulin (P = .38). Internal circadian time affects glucose tolerance in shift workers. Separately, circadian misalignment reduces glucose tolerance in shift workers, providing a mechanism to help explain the increased diabetes risk in shift workers.","2016"

Therefore, little is known about the combined effect of time spent in sleep, SB and physical activity, that together constitute a composite whole, on obesity and cardio-metabolic health markers. Cross-sectional analysis of NHANES 2005-6 cycle on N = 1937 adults, was undertaken using a compositional analysis paradigm, which accounts for this intrinsic codependence. Time spent in SB, light intensity (LIPA) and moderate to vigorous activity (MVPA) was determined from accelerometry and combined with self-reported sleep time to obtain the 24 hour time budget composition. The distribution of time spent in sleep, SB, LIPA and MVPA is significantly associated with BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, plasma glucose, plasma insulin (all p<0.001), and systolic (p<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.003), but not HDL or LDL. Within the composition, the strongest positive effect is found for the proportion of time spent in MVPA. Strikingly, the effects of MVPA replacing another behavior and of MVPA being displaced by another behavior are asymmetric. For example, re-allocating 10 minutes of SB to MVPA was associated with a lower waist circumference by 0.001% but if 10 minutes of MVPA is displaced by SB this was associated with a 0.84% higher waist circumference. The proportion of time spent in LIPA and SB were detrimentally associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease markers, but the association with SB was stronger. For diabetes risk markers, replacing SB with LIPA was associated with more favorable outcomes. Time spent in MVPA is an important target for intervention and preventing transfer of time from LIPA to SB might lessen the negative effects of physical inactivity.","2015"

To investigate the hypothesis that 10 weeks of HIT, performed in an instructor-led, group-based gym setting, elicits improvements in aerobic capacity (VO2max), cardio-metabolic risk and psychological health which are comparable to MICT. Ninety physically inactive volunteers (42±11 y, 27.7±4.8 kg.m-2) were randomly assigned to HIT or MICT group exercise classes. HIT consisted of repeated sprints (15-60 seconds, >90% HRmax) interspersed with periods of recovery cycling (≤25 min.session-1, 3 sessions.week-1). MICT participants performed continuous cycling (~70% HRmax, 30-45 min.session-1, 5 sessions.week-1). VO2max, markers of cardio-metabolic risk, and psychological health were assessed pre and post-intervention. Mean weekly training time was 55±10 (HIT) and 128±44 min (MICT) (p<0.05), with greater adherence to HIT (83±14% vs. 61±15% prescribed sessions attended, respectively; p<0.05). HIT improved VO2max, insulin sensitivity, reduced abdominal fat mass, and induced favourable changes in blood lipids (p<0.05). HIT also induced beneficial effects on health perceptions, positive and negative affect, and subjective vitality (p<0.05). No difference between HIT and MICT was seen for any of these variables. HIT performed in a real-world gym setting improves cardio-metabolic risk factors and psychological health in physically inactive adults.

MODY constitutes genetically and clinically heterogeneous forms of diabetes. More than 8 different genes are known to cause MODY, among which hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A) (MODY3) and glucokinase (GCK) (MODY2) mutations are the most common. Both forms of MODY are characterised by specific beta cell dysfunction, with patients with HNF1A-diabetes having a reduced insulin secretory capacity, while patients with GCK-diabetes have a glucose-sensing defect, but preserved insulin secretory capacity. Patients with MODY are effectively treated with sulphonylurea (SU) due to very high sensitivity to these drugs, but they are also prone to develop hypoglycaemia. The objectives of this thesis were to study the pathophysiology of GCK-diabetes and HNF1A-diabetes by investigating the incretin effect, the physiological response to food ingestion and to estimate the treatment potential of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) in patients with HNF1A-diabetes. In Study I we investigated the incretin effect and the responses of islet hormones and incretin hormones to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and isoglycaemic IV glucose infusion (IIGI) in patients with GCK-diabetes, in patients with HNF1A-diabetes, and in BMI and age matched healthy individuals (CTRLs). In Study II we investigated responses of islet hormones and incretin hormones to a more physiological stimulus consisting of a standardised meal test in patients with GCK-diabetes, in patients with HNF1A--diabetes, and in BMI and age matched CTRLs. In Study III we conducted a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial investigating the glucose lowering effect and risk of hypoglycaemia during 6 weeks of treatment with the GLP-1RA, liraglutide compared to the SU, glimepiride in 16 patients with HNF1A-diabetes. At baseline and at the end of each treatment period a standardised meal test followed by a light bicycling test was performed. The results of the studies showed that patients with HNF1A-diabetes were less glucose tolerant than patients with GCK-diabetes, but both groups were more glucose intolerant than CTRLs. In spite of glucose intolerance patients with GCK-diabetes showed normal incretin effect, whereas patients with HNF1A-diabetes showed an impaired incretin effect. Patients with HNF1A-diabetes were also characterised by an inappropriate insulin response. Normal insulin sensitivity was found in both groups of diabetes patients. In the prospective intervention trial a glucose lowering effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was demonstrated with both treatments without significant difference between the treatments. The postprandial plasma glucose responses were also lower with both glimepiride and liraglutide compared to baseline without significant difference between treatments. In spite of these findings glimepiride seems to have superior glucose lowering effects according to both FPG and postprandial glucose responses. Hypoglycaemic events (plasma glucose ≤ 3.9 mM) occurred 18 times during glimepiride treatment and once during liraglutide treatment. No differences between treatments were demonstrated according to insulin and glucagon responses and gastric emptying, and counter-regulatory responses were preserved during both treatments. No effect of either treatment was seen on fructosamine or HbA1c. In conclusion, patients with GCK-diabetes show normal incretin and glucagon physiology, thus resembling healthy individuals, in spite of fasting hyperglycaemia and subtle glucose intolerance. In contrast, patients with HNF1A-diabetes exhibited noticeable glucose intolerance, beta cell dysfunction, impaired incretin effect, and inappropriate glucagon response to oral stimuli, hence resembling patients with type 2 diabetes. However, normal responses of incretin hormones and normal insulin sensitivity were found in patients with HNF1A-diabetes. Six weeks of treatment with glimepiride or liraglutide demonstrated glucose lowering effects. This effect was greater with glimepiride, although insignificant, but at the expense of a higher risk of hypoglycaemia (predominantly mild). GLP-1RAs may have a place in treatment of patients with HNF1A-diabetes, especially when hypoglycaemia is a problem. Future studies are required to clarify this.","2015"

We retrospectively identified 95 obese patients at their entry into a 9-month Med and HIIT program: 21 were trained on a water-immersed ergocycle and 74 on a standard dryland ergocycle. Body composition, cardiometabolic and exercise parameters were measured before and after the program. For obese patients performing water- and dryland-exercise (mean age 58±9 years versus 55±7 years), BMI was higher for the water- than dryland-exercise group (39.4±8.3kg/m(2) versus 34.7±5.1kg/m(2), P<0.05), and total fat mass, fasting glycemia and triglycerides level were higher (P<0.05). Both groups showed similarly improved body composition variables (body mass, waist circumference, fat mass, P<0.001), fasting glycemia and triglycerides level (P<0.05). Initial maximal aerobic capacity (metabolic equivalents [METs]) and maximal heart rate (HRmax) were lower for the water- than dryland-exercise group (P<0.05). For both groups, METs, resting HR, resting blood pressure, abdominal and leg muscle endurance were similarly improved (P<0.05).

Twenty-eight subjects were allocated to one of two groups: HIIT, which performed three sessions per week of four high-intensity cycling intervals, or a control group (CON), which maintained their normal level of physical activity. Diet was controlled for all subjects to ensure weight stability. Pre- and postintervention (pre/post), subjects completed an incremental cycling test to limit of tolerance and, following a 10-day high-fat controlled feeding period, a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to determine insulin sensitivity and substrate oxidation. Nine members of HIIT (age, 29 ± 4 yr; body mass, 90.1 ± 13.8 kg) and eleven members of CON (age, 30 ± 7 yr; body mass, 85.5 ± 10.7 kg) completed the study. HIIT experienced an increased limit of tolerance (post, 1,124 ± 202 s; pre, 987 ± 146 s; P < 0.05), gas exchange threshold (post, 1.29 ± 0.34 liters/min; pre, 0.97 ± 0.23 liters/min; P < 0.05), and fat oxidation at the same absolute submaximal work rate compared with CON (P < 0.05 for group-by-time interaction in all cases). However, changes in peak oxygen consumption (V̇o2peak), insulin sensitivity, free fatty acid suppression during insulin stimulation, and metabolic flexibility were not different in HIIT compared with CON. High-intensity interval training with weight stability increased exercise fat oxidation and tolerance in subjects at risk for diabetic progression, but did not improve insulin sensitivity or fat oxidation in the postabsorptive or insulin-stimulated state.","2015"

It is characterized by a generalized reduction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of calorie restriction and ketogenic diet on neuroblastoma tumor growth and monitor potential adaptive mechanisms of the cancer's oxidative phosphorylation system. Xenografts were established in CD-1 nude mice by subcutaneous injection of two neuroblastoma cell lines having distinct genetic characteristics and therapeutic sensitivity [SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2)]. Mice were randomized to four treatment groups receiving standard diet, calorie-restricted standard diet, long chain fatty acid based ketogenic diet or calorie-restricted ketogenic diet. Tumor growth, survival, metabolic parameters and weight of the mice were monitored. Cancer tissue was evaluated for diet-induced changes of proliferation indices and multiple oxidative phosphorylation system parameters (respiratory chain enzyme activities, western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and mitochondrial DNA content). Ketogenic diet and/or calorie restriction significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in the xenograft model. Neuroblastoma growth reduction correlated with decreased blood glucose concentrations and was characterized by a significant decrease in Ki-67 and phospho-histone H3 levels in the diet groups with low tumor growth. As in human tumor tissue, neuroblastoma xenografts showed distinctly low mitochondrial complex II activity in combination with a generalized low level of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, validating the tumor model. Neuroblastoma showed no ability to adapt its mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity to the change in nutrient supply induced by dietary intervention. Our data suggest that targeting the metabolic characteristics of neuroblastoma could open a new front in supporting standard therapy regimens. Therefore, we propose that a ketogenic diet and/or calorie restriction should be further evaluated as a possible adjuvant therapy for patients undergoing treatment for neuroblastoma.","2015"

Post hoc subgroup analysis of a single-centre randomised controlled trial. A total of 139 patients with STEMI, randomised during ambulance transport to hospital for pPCI with (n=71) or without (n=68) RIC, met the trial criteria and achieved data for a myocardial salvage index (MSI).

However, the metabolic response to exercise training is variable, and the precise clinical and molecular determinants that mark the metabolic improvements remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis that clinical improvements in glucose control after low-intensity exercise in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are coupled to alterations in skeletal muscle gene expression. We investigated 14 overweight individuals with IGT before and after a 4-month low-intensity unsupervised walking exercise intervention. Clinical and anthropometric measurements and glucose tolerance were determined before and after the intervention. Skeletal muscle biopsy specimens were obtained for mRNA expression analysis. Waist circumference and work capacity during cycle ergometry were improved in individuals who achieved normal glucose tolerance (NGT) after exercise training (IGT-NGT; n = 9) but in not individuals who remained IGT (IGT-IGT; n = 5). Pretraining glycemic control was better in IGT-NGT compared with IGT-IGT. mRNA expression of mitochondrial markers and transcription factors was increased in IGT-NGT after exercise intervention and normalized to levels measured in a separate cohort of nonexercised individuals with NGT. Conversely, these markers were unaltered after exercise intervention in IGT-IGT. Normalization of metabolic control can be achieved after low-intensity exercise in individuals with IGT. This can be tracked with increased mRNA expression of mitochondrial and metabolic genes in skeletal muscle. However, for individuals presenting with a greater derangement in glycemia, the potential for clinical and metabolic improvements after this low-intensity unsupervised exercise protocol appears to be limited.","2015"

This is particularly the case for patients with multivessel coronary disease who are treated with percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). A considerable part of the IHD population are subjects with metabolic syndrome (MetS) who participate in comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CCR) programs as a part of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. To evaluate prospectively conventional risk factors within MetS, including uric acid (UA) level, in men with IHD after PCI or CABG who participated in ambulatory CCR. The study included 90 adult men (mean age 59.1 ± 7.31 years) with IHD after PCI (n = 63, 70%) or CABG (n = 27, 30%) referred for ambulatory CCR on average 30-60 days after an acute coronary syndrome. All subjects were examined twice 2 months apart - at the referral for CCR and after completion of CCR. MetS was diagnosed based on the measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference (WC), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and fasting blood glucose levels. In all subjects, UA level was also measured and the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI) were calculated. Following clinical evaluation and exercise test, each patient underwent 24 interval training sessions on a cycle ergometer. The patients received drug therapy including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, and acetylsalicylic acid. As a part of CCR, the patients also received education regarding healthy lifestyle changes including physical activity, healthy diet, stress coping techniques, effects of nicotine and alcohol, and effective methods to eliminate these habits. In most subjects, WC, BMI and WHR did not change significantly after the period of 2 months of CCR, and WC and BMI increased in the CABG subgroup (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.0178, respectively). Irrespective of the type of cardiac intervention, significant increases in exercise capacity and physical effort tolerance were observed after 2 months of CCR (p < 0.00001). TG level increased in all participants (p = 0.0514) and in the PCI subgroup (p = 0.0489). Systolic blood pressure decreased in all participants (p = 0.0216) and in the PCI subgroup (p = 0.0043). Mean UA level also decreased in all patients regardless of the type of cardiac intervention. Overall, the proportion of patients with the diagnosis of MetS did not change significantly after 2 months of CCR (36% vs. 31%, p > 0.05). However, the rate of MetS decreased in the PCI subgroup (from 46% to 29%, p = 0.043) and increased in the CABG subgroup (from 11% do 37%, p = 0.0562). The effect of participation in CCR on the metabolic risk in men with IHD varies depending on the type of earlier cardiac intervention. The metabolic risk decreased in patients treated with PCI, while it increased in those treated with CABG. In order to reduce the metabolic risk, particularly in CABG patients, a CCR program requires intensification of the patient support including educational activities regarding diet and weight reduction as well as individually prescribed physical activity.","2015"

In a 6wk controlled 2-stage randomized dietary intervention 32 healthy men (26±4y, BMI: 24±2kg/m2) followed 1wk of overfeeding (OF), 3wks of caloric restriction (CR) containing either 50% or 65% carbohydrate (CHO) and 2wks of refeeding (RF) with the same amount of CHO but either low or high glycaemic index at ±50% energy requirement. Measures of IS (basal: HOMA-index, postprandial: Matsuda-ISI), insulin secretion (early: Stumvoll-index, total: tAUC-insulin/tAUC-glucose) and potential endocrine determinants (ghrelin, leptin, adiponectin, thyroid hormone levels, 24h-urinary catecholamine excretion) were assessed. IS improved and insulin secretion decreased due to CR and normalized upon RF. Weight loss-induced improvements in basal and postprandial IS were associated with decreases in leptin and increases in ghrelin levels, respectively (r = 0.36 and r = 0.62, p<0.05). Weight regain-induced decrease in postprandial IS correlated with increases in adiponectin, fT3, TSH, GL of the diet and a decrease in ghrelin levels (r-values between -0.40 and 0.83, p<0.05) whereas increases in early and total insulin secretion were associated with a decrease in leptin/adiponectin-ratio (r = -0.52 and r = -0.46, p<0.05) and a decrease in fT4 (r = -0.38, p<0.05 for total insulin secretion only). After controlling for GL associations between RF-induced decrease in postprandial IS and increases in fT3 and TSH levels were no longer significant. Weight cycling induced changes in IS and insulin secretion were associated with changes in all measured hormones, except for catecholamine excretion.

Twenty-five patients were assigned to receive marjoram tea or a placebo tea twice daily for 1 month (intervention group: n = 14; placebo group: n = 11). The hormonal and metabolic parameters measured at baseline, as well as after the intervention, were: follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, progesterone, oestradiol, total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S), fasting insulin and glucose, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and glucose to insulin ratio.

In comparison to the placebo group, the change was only significant for DHEA-S (P = 0.05) but not for insulin (P = 0.08). HOMA-IR was not reduced significantly in the intervention group (P = 0.06), although the change was significant compared to the placebo group (P < 0.05). The results obtained in the present study show the beneficial effects of marjoram tea on the hormonal profile of PCOS women because it was found to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the levels of adrenal androgens. Further research is needed to confirm these results and to investigate the active components and mechanisms contributing to such potential beneficial effects of marjoram herb.","2016"

Therefore, expectations are high that telehealth can help alleviate prevailing challenges in health care delivery. However, in order to translate current research to policy and facilitate adoption by patients and health care providers, there is need for compelling evidence of the effectiveness of telehealth interventions. Such evidence is gathered from rigorously designed research studies, which may not always be practical in many real-world settings. Our aim was to summarize current telehealth evaluation strategies and challenges and to outline practical approaches to conduct evaluation in real-world settings using one of our previously reported telehealth initiatives, the Diabetes Connect program, as a case study. We reviewed commonly used current evaluation frameworks and strategies, as well as best practices based on successful evaluative efforts to date to address commonly encountered challenges in telehealth evaluation. These challenges in telehealth evaluation and commonly used frameworks are described relevant to the evaluation of Diabetes Connect, a 12-month Web-based blood glucose monitoring program. Designers of telehealth evaluation frameworks must give careful consideration to the elements of planning, implementation, and impact assessment of interventions. Evaluating performance at each of these phases is critical to the overall success of an intervention. Although impact assessment occurs at the end of a program, our review shows that it should begin at the point of problem definition. Critical to the success of an evaluative strategy is early planning that involves all stakeholders to identify the overall goals of the program and key measures of success at each phase of the program life cycle. This strategy should enable selection of an appropriate evaluation strategy and measures to aid in the ongoing development and implementation of telehealth and provide better evidence of program impact. We recommend a pragmatic, multi-method, multi-phase approach to telehealth evaluation that is flexible and can be adapted to the characteristics and challenges unique to each telehealth program.","2014"

Glucose transporter type I deficiency (G1D) is commonly associated with seizures and with electrographic spike-waves. The G1D syndrome has long been attributed to energy (ie, adenosine triphosphate synthetic) failure such as that consequent to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate depletion. Indeed, glucose and other substrates generate TCAs via anaplerosis. However, TCAs are preserved in murine G1D, rendering energy-failure inferences premature and suggesting a different hypothesis, also grounded on our work, that consumption of alternate TCA precursors is stimulated and may be detrimental. Second, common ketogenic diets lead to a therapeutically counterintuitive reduction in blood glucose available to the G1D brain and prove ineffective in one-third of patients. To identify the most helpful outcomes for treatment evaluation and to uphold (rather than diminish) blood glucose concentration and stimulate the TCA cycle, including anaplerosis, in G1D using the medium-chain, food-grade triglyceride triheptanoin.

Fourteen children and adults with G1D who were not receiving a ketogenic diet were selected on a first-come, first-enrolled basis. Supplementation of the regular diet with food-grade triheptanoin. First, we show that, regardless of electroencephalographic spike-waves, most seizures are rarely visible, such that perceptions by patients or others are inadequate for treatment evaluation. Thus, we used quantitative electroencephalographic, neuropsychological, blood analytical, and magnetic resonance imaging cerebral metabolic rate measurements. One participant (7%) did not manifest spike-waves; however, spike-waves promptly decreased by 70% (P = .001) in the other participants after consumption of triheptanoin. In addition, the neuropsychological performance and cerebral metabolic rate increased in most patients. Eleven patients (78%) had no adverse effects after prolonged use of triheptanoin. Three patients (21%) experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, and 1 (7%) discontinued the use of triheptanoin. Triheptanoin can favorably influence cardinal aspects of neural function in G1D.

PATIENTS diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=10, no withdrawals) participated in the study. Subjects performed three 1-hour interventions: 1) interval walking (IW; repeated cycles of 3 min of slow and fast walking); 2) continuous walking (CW); and 3) control (CON). Oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured continuously to match mean VO2 between exercise sessions (∼75% VO2peak).

They underwent 3 performance tests including 125-min steady status exercise (SS) and 20-min time trial (TT) on an indoor stationary trainer at the start of the study (BL) and at the end of each intervention phase. Venous blood was collected in the morning prior to the performance test for biochemical measurements and finger blood during the test for glucose determination. Carbohydrate and fat oxidation, energy expenditure, and oxygen use were calculated using respiratory gas analysis. ALM increased cycling distance during TT by 1.7 km as compared BL (21.9 vs. 20.2 km, P = 0.053) and COK increased 0.6 km (20.8 vs. 20.2 km, P > 0.05). ALM, but not COK, led to higher CHO and lower fat oxidation and less oxygen consumption during TT than BL (P < 0.05), whereas there was no significant difference in heart rate among BL, ALM and COK. ALM maintained higher blood glucose level after TT than COK (P < 0.05). ALM had higher vitamin E and haemoglobin and lower serum free fatty acid (P < 0.05), slightly elevated serum arginine and nitric oxide and plasma insulin (P > 0.05) than BL, and a higher total antioxidant capacity than COK (P < 0.05). Whole almonds improved cycling distance and the elements related to endurance performance more than isocaloric cookies in trained athletes as some nutrients in almonds may contribute to CHO reservation and utilization and effective oxygen utilization. The results suggest that almonds can be incorporated into diets of those who undertake exercise training for performance improvement.","2014"

Metabolic health (oral glucose tolerance test), aerobic capacity (incremental time to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer) and physical function (get up and go test, sit to stand test and loaded 50 m walk) were determined before and after training. Following eight weeks of HIT there was a significant improvement in aerobic capacity (8% increase in VO2 peak; p < 0.001), physical function (11%-27% respectively; p < 0.05) and a reduction in blood glucose area under the curve (6% reduction; p < 0.05). This study demonstrates for the first time the potential of HIT as a training intervention to improve skeletal muscle function and glucose clearance as we age.","2014"

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is proposed as a crucial disease mechanism in obese and insulin-resistant animals (such as ob/ob mice) with simple steatosis, but its role in NASH remains controversial. We therefore evaluated the role of ER stress as a disease mechanism in foz/foz mice, which develop both the metabolic and histological features that mimic human NASH. We explored ER stress markers in the liver of foz/foz mice in response to a high-fat diet (HFD) at several time points. We then evaluated the effect of treatment with an ER stress inducer tunicamycin, or conversely with the ER protectant tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), on the metabolic and hepatic features. foz/foz mice are obese, glucose intolerant and develop NASH characterized by steatosis, inflammation, ballooned hepatocytes and apoptosis from 6 weeks of HFD feeding. This was not associated with activation of the upstream unfolded protein response [phospho-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) activity and spliced X-box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1)]. Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and up-regulation of activating transcription factor-4 (Atf4) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (Chop) transcripts were however compatible with a 'pathological' response to ER stress. We tested this by using intervention experiments. Induction of chronic ER stress failed to worsen obesity, glucose intolerance and NASH pathology in HFD-fed foz/foz mice. In addition, the ER protectant TUDCA, although reducing steatosis, failed to improve glucose intolerance, hepatic inflammation and apoptosis in HFD-fed foz/foz mice. These results show that signals driving hepatic inflammation, apoptosis and insulin resistance are independent of ER stress in obese diabetic mice with steatohepatitis.","2014"

In this randomized controlled clinical trial, the patients (n=54) were randomly allocated to the intervention group as 'high-onion' (raw red onions: 2 × 40-50 g/day if overweight and 2 × 50-60 g/day if obese) or to the control group as 'low-onion' (raw red onions: 2 × 10-15 g/day) along with limited liliaceous vegetables for 8 weeks. Body mass index, dietary record, and metabolic parameters (fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lipoprotein (a)) were evaluated in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle at baseline and after 8 weeks. Hormonal variables (progesterone, prolactin, and 17-OH progesterone) were also measured at baseline. Onion significantly decreased the levels of total cholesterol within each group; however, these changes were stronger in the high-onion group (weighted mean differences [WMD]: -5.60 [95% confidence interval [CI]: -9.16, -2.03]; P=0.003) than in the low-onion group (WMD: -6.42 [95%CI: -11.97, -0.87]; P=0.025). Similarly, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly (WMD: -5.13 [95%CI: -9.46, -0.81); P=0.022) in the high-onion group, and (WMD: -2.90 [95%CI -5.57, -0.21]; P=0.035) in the low-onion group after treatment. The levels of fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein (a) did not differ significantly after 8-week onion treatment. Adjustment for confounders did not make any significant changes in any of the parameters in post-treatment levels. Raw red onion consumption appears to be effective as a cholesterol-lowering food agent in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. However, further investigation is warranted.","2014"

Furthermore, many women remain sedentary during pregnancy because of perceived barriers to exercise participation. This study examined the effectiveness of a home-based cycling program commenced upon diagnosis of GDM on daily fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the response of glucose and insulin to a 75-g oral glucose load. Forty sedentary women (28.8 ± 0.9 wk of gestation) were randomized to either home-based exercise training in combination with conventional management (EX, n = 20) or to conventional management alone (CON, n = 20) until week 34 of pregnancy. Mean compliance to the supervised exercise training was 96%, and no adverse effects were reported. Capillary glucose concentration was acutely reduced in response to each cycling session (6.3 ± 0.8 mM to 4.9 ± 0.7 mM, P < 0.001). Overall, the EX group had lower mean daily postprandial glucose concentrations throughout the intervention compared with that in the CON group (P < 0.05) despite consuming a greater proportion of dietary carbohydrate (P < 0.05). No differences were observed between groups with respect to HbA1c or the glucose and insulin response to oral glucose ingestion postintervention (P > 0.05).

In fact, it has been suggested that the disruption of the circadian system may play a causal role in manifestations of MetS. The aim of this research was to find out whether habitual consumption of a low-fat diet, compared with a Mediterranean diet enriched with olive oil, modulates the associations between common CLOCK single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1801260, rs3749474 and rs4580704) and lipid and glucose-related traits among MetS patients. Plasma lipid and insulin concentrations, indexes related with insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI)) and CLOCK SNPs were determined in 475 MetS subjects participating in the CORDIOPREV clinical trial (NCT00924937). Gene-diet interactions were analyzed after a year of dietary intervention (Mediterranean diet (35% fat, 22% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) versus low-fat diet (28% fat, 12% MUFA)). We found significant gene-diet interactions between rs1801260 SNP and the dietary pattern for insulin concentrations (p = 0.009), HOMA-IR (p = 0.014) and QUICKI (p = 0.028). Specifically, after 12 months of low-fat intervention, subjects who were homozygous for the major allele (TT) displayed lower plasma insulin concentrations (p = 0.032), lower insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; p = 0.027) and higher insulin sensitivity (QUICKI; p = 0.024) compared with carriers of the minor allele C (TC + CC). In contrast, in the Mediterranean intervention group a different trend was observed although no significant differences were found between CLOCK genotypes after 12 months of treatment. Our data support the notion that a chronic consumption of a healthy diet may play a contributing role in triggering glucose metabolism by interacting with the rs1801260 SNP at CLOCK gene locus in MetS patients. Due to the complex nature of gene-environment interactions, dietary adjustment in subjects with the MetS may require a personalized approach.","2014"

Hyperglycemia in RMS is very difficult to treat, and patients are at risk for early morbidity and mortality from complications of diabetes. Our objective was to study 1-year effects of recombinant human methionyl leptin (metreleptin) in 5 patients with RMS and 10-year effects in 2 of these patients. We conducted an open-label nonrandomized study at the National Institutes of Health. Patients were adolescents with RMS and poorly controlled diabetes. Two patients were treated with escalating doses (0.02 up to 0.22 mg/kg/d) of metreleptin for 10 years, including 3 cycles of metreleptin withdrawal and reinitiation. In all 5 patients, 1-year effects of metreleptin (0.22 mg/kg/d) were studied. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI) z-scores were evaluated every 6 months. HbA1c decreased from 11.4% ± 1.1% at baseline to 9.3% ± 1.9% after 6 months and 9.7% ± 1.6% after 12 months of metreleptin (P = .007). In patients treated for 10 years, HbA1c declined with each cycle of metreleptin and rose with each withdrawal. BMI z-scores declined from -1.4 ± 1.8 at baseline, to -2.6 ± 1.6 after 12 months of metreleptin (P = .0006). Changes in BMI z-score correlated with changes in HbA1c (P < .0001). Metreleptin treatment for 12 months was associated with a 1.7% reduction in HbA1c; part of this improvement was likely mediated via decreased BMI. Metreleptin is a promising treatment option for RMS, but additional therapies are needed to achieve HbA1c targets.","2013"

Association of obesity with insulin resistance and related cardiometabolic problems is well established. Traditionally, adipose tissue in visceral fat depot has been considered a major culprit in development of insulin resistance. However, growing body of the literature has suggested that adipose tissue in subcutaneous fat depot, not only due to larger volume but also due to inherent functional characteristics, can have significant impact on development of insulin resistance. There are significant differences in functional characteristics of subcutaneous abdominal/truncal versus gluteofemoral depots. Decreased capacity for adipocyte differentiation and angiogenesis along with adipocyte hypertrophy can trigger vicious cycle of inflammation in subcutaneous adipose tissue and subsequent ectopic fat deposition. It is important to shift focus from fat content to functional heterogeneity in adipose tissue depots to better understand the relative role of subcutaneous adipose tissue in metabolic complications of obesity. Therapeutic lifestyle change continues to be the most important intervention in clinical practice at any level of increased adiposity. Future pharmaceutical interventions aimed at improving adipose tissue function in various subcutaneous depots have potential to help maintain adequate insulin sensitivity and reduce risk for development of insulin resistance complications.","2013"

Data were from the first 12 weeks of a 52-week, prospective, randomized trial comparing RT-CGM (n = 50) with self-monitoring of blood glucose (n = 50). RT-CGM was used in 8 of the first 12 weeks. A1C was collected at baseline and quarterly. This analysis included 45 participants who wore the RT-CGM ≥4 weeks. Analyses examined the RT-CGM data for common response patterns-a novel approach in this area of research. It then used multilevel models for longitudinal data, regression, and nonparametric methods to compare the patterns of A1C, mean glucose, glycemic variability, and views per day of the RT-CGM device. There were five patterns. For four patterns, mean glucose was lower than expected as of the first RT-CGM cycle of use given participants' baseline A1C. We named them favorable response but with high and variable glucose (n = 7); tight control (n = 14); worsening glycemia (n = 6); and incremental improvement (n = 11). The fifth was no response (n = 7). A1C, mean glucose, glycemic variability, and views per day differed across patterns at baseline and longitudinally.

Third, common clinical quandaries, such as discrepancies between A1C and self-monitoring of blood glucose data, as well as misconceptions about long-term glycemic assessment, compound entrenched cycles of inadequate self-care, delayed intervention, and suboptimal glycemic outcomes. Because individual, clinical, and public policy responses to these conflicting forces are based largely on methodologies for glucose measurement, a panel of clinical experts from Europe and North America was convened to reexamine our glucose measuring tools and determine ways in which they can be better applied toward more purposeful processes of glycemic management. Among the main issues addressed were the need for caution in interpreting A1C for individual patients, the role of alternative biomarkers in identifying aspects of glycemic dysregulation not captured by A1C, and the value of using patients' own glucose data to consolidate therapeutic, educational, and behavior-change objectives.","2012"

The need to structure these programs for outpatient and community care with a vision for long-term maintenance has been recognised. In Reunion Island, an area affected by epidemiological and nutritional transition, diabetes affects 18% of the adult population over 30 years, with major social disparities, poor glycaemic control and frequent cardiovascular complications. ERMIES is a randomised controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of a long-term (2 years) structured group self management educational intervention in improving blood glucose in non-recent, insufficiently controlled diabetes. After an initial structured educational cycle carried out blind for the intervention arm, patients will be randomised in two parallel group arms of 120 subjects: structured on-going group with educational intervention maintained over two years, versus only initial education. Education sessions are organised through a regional diabetes management network, and performed by trained registered nurses at close quarters. The educational approach is theoretically based (socio-constructivism, social contextualisation, empowerment, action planning) and reproducible, thanks to curricula and handouts for educators and learners. The subjects will be recruited from five hospital outpatient settings all over Reunion Island. The main eligibility criteria include: age ≥18 years, type 2 diabetes treated for more than one year, HbA1c ≥ 7.5% for ≥3 months, without any severe evolving complication (ischaemic or proliferative retinopathy, severe renal insufficiency, coronaropathy or evolving foot lesion), and absence of any major physical or cognitive handicap. The primary outcome measure is HbA1c evolution between inclusion and 2 years. The secondary outcome measures include anthropometric indicators, blood pressure, lipids, antidiabetic medications, level of physical activity, food ingestion, quality of life, social support, anxiety, depression levels and self-efficacy. An associated nested qualitative study will be conducted with 30 to 40 subjects in order to analyse the learning and adaptation processes during the education cycles, and throughout the study. This research will help to address the necessary but difficult issue of structuring therapeutic education in type 2 diabetes based on: efficacy and potential interest of organising on-going empowerment group-sessions, at close quarters, over the long term, in a heterogeneous socioeconomic environment.

However, it remains controversial whether hypertrophy resistance training (HRT) is superior to endurance resistance training (ERT) with regard to its effects on glycaemic control, muscle mass and strength. Thirty-two patients with T2DM (13 men and 19 women; 64.8 ± 7.8 years) were randomly assigned to either eight weeks of HRT (n = 16; 2 sets, 10-12 repetitions, 70% of the one-repetition maximum (1-RM)) or ERT (n = 16; 2 sets, 25-30 repetitions, 40% 1-RM). In addition, all patients participated in aerobic exercise training (AET; 1 hour/day on 2 non-consecutive days/week; cycle ergometer; 70% of heart rate reserve). After eight weeks of intervention, there were time but not group effects for reduced glucose and fructosamine levels, weight, BMI, waist circumference, subcutaneous abdominal fat, resting heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure; muscle mass of the arms and physical exercise capacity increased significantly. Significant time and group effects were documented for maximum strength of the chest, with a greater increase for HRT than ERT (p = 0.01). Specific maximal resistance training of the chest muscles led to superior gain in strength as compared to endurance resistance training. This, however, did not translate into superior values of glycaemic control, weight, waist circumference, muscle mass and physical work capacity, which all improved significantly by a similar magnitude in both groups. Since overall effects of both protocols were comparable, both may be offered to patients according to their personal preference.","2013"

Five diabetic morbidly obese patients and 5 nondiabetic morbidly obese patients undergoing biliopancreatic diversion were compared retrospectively. A 75-g trans-gastrostomy glucose tolerance test was administered on the fifth day postoperatively and a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed on the seventh day postoperatively, with blood sampling for measuring plasma glucose and insulin levels at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes. All 5 diabetic patients were shown, at the same time, still to have diabetes or an impaired glucose tolerance test when tested through the biliopancreatic limb but patients were normal when tested through the new alimentary channel. No significant difference was seen in the nondiabetic patients. Biliopancreatic diversion can completely normalize the glycemic cycle in type 2 diabetes patients in the week after the intervention, even before any significant weight loss has occurred. The surgical procedure itself, designed to exclude most of the stomach, duodenum, and part of the jejunum, directly affects carbohydrate homeostasis.","2012"

Hypoestrogenism, due to suppression of hypothalamus-pituitary axis (HPA) as a result of energy imbalance, is the possible cause of the Triad. This study was designed based on following up and reassessment of elite female athletes who were diagnosed as menstrual dysfunction about two years ago. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THREE PHASE SECTIONS: 1) Reassess the pattern of menstrual cycle among athletes who reported menstrual dysfunction about two years ago; 2) Bone mineral density was measured twice in the same machine and same center with a two-year interval; 3) The laboratory data including blood glucose, lipid profile and inflammatory markers was assessed in phase 3. BMD of athletes did not change significantly after 25.5 months of oligomenorrhea P (spine) = 0.2, P (femur)=0.9. Mean of all cardiovascular factors was in the normal range except for high density lipoprotein (HDL) which was 49.28 (SD=9.18), however, most of the athletes had abnormalities in their lipid profile. Inverse relationship between the increase in the BMD of spine and total cholesterol (r =-0.49, P=0.04), Apolipoprotein A (r = -0.51 P=0.04), and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) (r =-0.66, P=0.009). Also correlation between BMD of spine and HbA1C (r =-0.70, P=0.003) were significant. Findings of this study show that negative changes in BMD and cardiovascular biomarkers of female athletes with functional hypothalamic menstrual dysfunction could occur if proper therapeutic intervention (including increase in calorie intake, decrease in exercise load or hormonal replacement) will not consider.","2012"

Model-based methods and computerized protocols offer the opportunity to improve TGC quality and compliance. This research presents an interface design to maximize compliance, minimize real and perceived clinical effort, and minimize error based on simple human factors and end user input. The graphical user interface (GUI) design is presented by construction based on a series of simple, short design criteria based on fundamental human factors engineering and includes the use of user feedback and focus groups comprising nursing staff at Christchurch Hospital. The overall design maximizes ease of use and minimizes (unnecessary) interaction and use. It is coupled to a protocol that allows nurse staff to select measurement intervals and thus self-manage workload. The overall GUI design is presented and requires only one data entry point per intervention cycle. The design and main interface are heavily focused on the nurse end users who are the predominant users, while additional detailed and longitudinal data, which are of interest to doctors guiding overall patient care, are available via tabs. This dichotomy of needs and interests based on the end user's immediate focus and goals shows how interfaces must adapt to offer different information to multiple types of users. The interface is designed to minimize real and perceived clinical effort, and ongoing pilot trials have reported high levels of acceptance. The overall design principles, approach, and testing methods are based on fundamental human factors principles designed to reduce user effort and error and are readily generalizable.","2012"

A total of 219 patients at risk for type 2 diabetes, who underwent a 9-month lifestyle intervention with diet modification and increase in physical activity, and had measurement of CRF, were studied. Insulin sensitivity was estimated during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Total body, visceral and liver fat were measured by magnetic resonance (MR) tomography and H-MR spectroscopy. CRF was estimated using two different methods, an incremental cycle exercise (maximal aerobic capacity-VO2max) test and a motorized treadmill (individual anaerobic threshold) test. After 9 months of intervention adiposity, glycemia, CRF, insulin sensitivity, SBP and serum lipids (except high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, P = 0.65) improved (all other P ≤ 0.006). DBP did not change significantly (P = 0.06).

Consequently, more young women are entering pregnancy with body mass indices of at least 30 kg/m(2). While higher maternal weight entering pregnancy is related to several adverse pregnancy outcomes, some of the strongest and most compelling data to date have linked prepregnancy obesity to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The mechanisms by which excess maternal weight influences metabolic dysfunction in pregnancy are similar to those in obese nonpregnant women; adipocytes are metabolically active and release a number of hormones implicated in insulin resistance. Heavier mothers are also more likely to have higher glucose levels that do not exceed the cutoff for GDM, but nevertheless predict poor perinatal outcomes. Longer-term complications of GDM include increased risk of maternal type 2 diabetes and offspring obesity. Promising intervention studies to decrease the intergenerational cycle of obesity and diabetes are currently underway.","2011"

Muscle, breath, and arterial and venous blood samples were obtained at rest, during 2 h of two-legged kicking exercise at approximately 45% of kicking Vo(2peak), and during 1 h of recovery. Biopsy samples confirmed that the muscle glycogen concentration was lower in the L-CHO group versus the H-CHO group at rest, after exercise, and after recovery. The net leg protein balance was decreased in the L-CHO group compared with at rest and compared with the H-CHO condition, which was primarily due to an increase in protein degradation (area under the curve of the phenylalanine rate of appearance: 1,331 + or - 162 micromol in the L-CHO group vs. 786 + or - 51 micromol in the H-CHO group, P < 0.05) but also due to a decrease in protein synthesis late in exercise. There were no changes during exercise in the rate of appearance compared with rest in the H-CHO group. Whole body leucine oxidation increased above rest in the L-CHO group only and was higher than in the H-CHO group. The whole body net protein balance was reduced in the L-CHO group, largely due to a decrease in whole body protein synthesis. These data extend previous findings by others and demonstrate, using contemporary stable isotope methodology, that CHO availability influences the rates of skeletal muscle and whole body protein synthesis, degradation, and net balance during prolonged exercise in humans.","2010"

Therefore, to better define the relationship between weight cycling, energy homeostasis, and future weight gain, we examined associations between frequent intentional weight loss and hormonal profiles in postmenopausal women. This cross-sectional study evaluated the relationship between a history of frequent weight loss and biomarkers, including serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and ghrelin, as well as sex steroid hormones. We hypothesized that frequent intentional weight loss would be associated with changes in normal appetite and body weight regulatory hormones, favoring increased appetite and weight gain. One hundred fifty-nine healthy, weight stable, sedentary, overweight, postmenopausal women who had been recruited for an exercise intervention participated in this study. History of intentional weight loss (frequency and magnitude) was assessed by questionnaire. Hormonal assays were performed by radioimmunoassay (insulin, leptin, ghrelin, estrogens, androgens, and dehydroepiandrosterone), chemiluminescence immunoassay (insulin-like growth factor-1), and immunometric assay (sex hormone binding globulin). Analysis of variance and regression analyses were used to investigate the relationship between weight loss history and metabolic hormones. A higher degree of weight cycling, characterized by the frequency of intentionally losing more than 10 lb, was associated with an appetite-stimulating hormonal profile, including higher concentrations of ghrelin (P trend = .04), lower glucose (P trend = .047), and to some extent, lower insulin (P trend = .08). Frequent weight loss was also associated with lower androgen concentrations, including androstenedione (P trend = .02), testosterone (P trend = .04), and free testosterone (P trend = .01). No independent associations between the concentrations of leptin or estrogens and weight cycling were observed. This study suggests that frequent intentional weight loss may affect hormones involved in energy regulation.","2010"

Secondary analysis of a 12-month, double-blind, randomized, parallel-therapy trial. Four teaching hospitals and one community hospital in Vancouver, Canada. Thirty-three healthy women who underwent premenopausal hysterectomy with bilateral ovariectomy. Subjects received either MPA 10 mg/day (18 women) or CEE 0.6 mg/day (15 women) for 12 months, started immediately after hysterectomy with bilateral ovariectomy. Lipid profiles (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL], total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and triglyceride levels), homeostatic measures (hemoglobin A(1c) and fasting blood glucose level), hormone levels (free and bioavailable testosterone, cortisol, sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG], and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate), inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP] and serum albumin levels), and anthropometric measures (body mass index [BMI], truncal fat, and total body fat) were assessed over the 12-month period. After 12 months, the women assigned to MPA had lesser increases in BMI (p=0.04), triglyceride (p=0.003), HDL (p<0.0005), SHBG (p<0.0005), total testosterone (p=0.003), and CRP values (p=0.01) and higher serum albumin levels (p<0.0005) compared with the women receiving CEE. Therapy with CEE, but not MPA, after surgical menopause appears to predispose healthy women to low-grade inflammation, as evidenced by its independent associations with elevated CRP and reduced albumin levels. In women treated with MPA, the favorable levels of inflammatory markers, BMI, and triglyceride levels need to be confirmed in larger controlled trials, as progesterone therapy may provide a safe and effective alternative to estrogen for vasomotor symptoms in women with surgical menopause.","2010"

Previous studies have suggested that the maternal environment, in particular a reduction in maternal insulin sensitivity, contributes significantly to fetal growth. Regular aerobic exercise, through an effect on maternal insulin sensitivity, may influence offspring size by regulating nutrient supply to the fetus. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of aerobic exercise training in the second half of pregnancy on maternal insulin sensitivity and neonatal outcomes. We conducted a community-based, randomized, controlled trial of exercise in pregnancy. Eighty-four healthy nulliparous women (mean +/- sd, age, 30 +/- 4 yr; body mass index, 25.5 +/- 4 kg/m(2)) participated in the study. Subjects participated in a home-based stationary cycling program from 20 wk gestation to delivery. Maternal insulin sensitivity, neonatal auxology, body composition, and growth-related peptides in cord blood were measured. Offspring of exercisers had lower birth weight (sd score, control, 0.23 +/- 0.8; exercise, -0.19 +/- 0.9; P = 0.03) and body mass index at birth (sd score, control, 0.40 +/- 0.9; exercise, -0.01 +/- 0.09; P = 0.04). The reduction in maternal insulin sensitivity in late gestation was not affected by exercise (P = 0.45) and was unrelated to offspring size. Exercise offspring had lower cord serum IGF-I (P = 0.03) and IGF-II (P = 0.04). Regular exercise was associated with lower birth weights and reduced cord concentrations of growth-related peptides, suggesting an influence of exercise on endocrine regulation of fetal growth. These effects on offspring growth were not associated with an exercise training effect on maternal insulin sensitivity.","2010"

Sixteen highly trained male cyclists and triathletes (age: 30.6+/-5.6 y; VO2max: 64.8+/-4.7 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1); mean+/-SD) participated in the study. One group (n=8) consumed a higher-CHO (8.5+/-1.7 g x kg(-1) body mass.day (-1)) diet for 28 days; a second group (n=8) consumed a moderate-CHO diet (5.3+/-0.4 g x kg (-1) x day (-1)). Total daily energy intakes were similar between the two groups. Cytokine responses to cycle ergometry were assessed prior to and again following the dietary intervention period. The cycle ergometry protocol involved 100 min steady state cycling at 70% VO2max followed by a time trial of approximately 30 min. Athletes were provided with 15 mL x kg (-1) x h (-1) of water during each trial. Blood samples were collected pre-, immediately post- and 1 h post-exercise for determination of plasma glucose and pro-inflammatory (IL-6, IL-8) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10, IL-1ra) cytokine concentrations. Cytokine responses to cycle ergometry were not substantially altered following the 28-day higher-CHO diet. In contrast, following the 28-day moderate-CHO diet, there were approximately 30-50% reductions (p=0.08-0.11) in anti-inflammatory cytokine responses post-exercise. These findings suggest that increased dietary CHO content alone does not effectively attenuate the pro-inflammatory cytokine response to exercise, however, there may be a small reduction in the anti-inflammatory cytokine response.","2010"

After baseline metabolic, anthropometric, and fitness measurements, participants completed a 2-week SIT intervention, comprising 6 sessions of 4 to 6 repeats of 30-second Wingate anaerobic sprints on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer, with 4.5-minute recovery between each repetition. Metabolic, anthropometric, and fitness assessments were repeated post-intervention. Both maximal oxygen uptake (2.98 ± 0.15 vs 3.23 ± 0.14 L min(-1), P = .013) and mean Wingate power (579 ± 24 vs 600 ± 19 W, P = .040) significantly increased after 2 weeks of SIT.

Subjects were treated with the GHR antagonist (n = 10; 10 mg/d) or placebo (n = 10). After the treatment period, they performed a maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2 max)) test and a prolonged exercise test, consisting of 60 min of submaximal cycling followed by exercise to fatigue at 90% of VO(2 max). VO(2 max) was measured before and after the treatment period. Hormonal and metabolic responses and time to exhaustion during prolonged exercise were determined. Resting serum IGF-I concentration decreased by 20% in the GHR antagonist-treated group (P < 0.05), whereas no change was observed in the placebo group. Conversely, resting serum GH concentration was significantly higher in the treatment group compared with the placebo group (P < 0.01).

MPILC exploits two key factors: frequent glucose readings made possible by continuous glucose monitoring technology; and the repetitive nature of glucose-meal-insulin dynamics with a 24-h cycle. The proposed algorithm can learn from an individual's lifestyle, allowing the control performance to be improved from day to day. After less than 10 days, the blood glucose concentrations can be kept within a range of 90-170 mg/dL. Generally, control performance under MPILC is better than that under MPC. The proposed methodology is robust to random variations in meal timings within +/-60 min or meal amounts within +/-75% of the nominal value, which validates MPILC's superior robustness compared to run-to-run control. Moreover, to further improve the algorithm's robustness, an automatic scheme for setpoint update that ensures safe convergence is proposed. Furthermore, the proposed method does not require user intervention; hence, the algorithm should be of particular interest for glycemic control in children and adolescents.","2010"

Furthermore, basal and insulin-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 was higher in DHEA-treated rats than in controls. Notwithstanding that both the hyperandrogenism and the hyperinsulinemia synergistic with hCG-treated rats displayed the typical traits of human polycystic ovary syndrome, there is a divergence in the insulin-signaling pathway in the ovarian tissue, which may have a role in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome.","2009"

To correlate social and cultural status with the phenotypic expression (body weight and ovulation) and with androgen and insulin levels of PCOS. University department of medicine. Two hundred and forty-four consecutive PCOS women. All studied patients completed a simple questionnaire to indicate their mean family income and their school education. Ovulation was assessed by measurement of serum progesterone on day 22 of a spontaneous or induced menstrual cycle. Levels of blood testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, insulin, and blood glucose were evaluated. In the low to medium income group, 21% of patients had ovulatory PCOS, but the prevalence of the same PCOS phenotype was 43% in patients with high income. In patients with low education, only 12% presented with ovulatory PCOS compared with 47% of the patients with high education status. Mean family income negatively correlated with body mass index, waist circumference, insulin, and insulin resistance. Serum progesterone correlated negatively with insulin and insulin resistance. In an ethnically homogeneous PCOS population, high socioeconomic status was associated with a higher prevalence of the ovulatory phenotype. Differences in ovulatory status between the social classes seem to be related to differences in insulin levels and fat quantity and distribution.","2009"

Cross-sectional analysis. Endocrine clinic in China. Thirty-four women with PCOS and 41 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls were recruited. Fasting blood samples were collected. Plasma glucose, insulin, lipids, ASP, C3, CRP, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were measured. Plasma ASP, CRP, insulin, cholesterol, and nonesterified fatty acids were increased significantly in women with PCOS compared with in controls. Although each of these parameters also was statistically significantly correlated directly with BMI, the association with PCOS status was independent of BMI, with increased plasma values at all levels of BMI. In control subjects, CRP and C3 correlated with glucose and triglyceride, only CRP correlated with nonesterified fatty acids and cholesterol, and ASP correlated with triglyceride (again, all correlations were significant), whereas in subjects with PCOS, several of these correlations were lost, as a result of consistently higher levels of CRP and ASP regardless of BMI. Levels of ASP, CRP, and lipids are increased in subjects with PCOS, regardless of the level of BMI. The increased ASP level in both PCOS groups suggests that the ASP metabolism may be altered.","2009"

Ghrelin, gastric peptide with potent orexigenic, adipogenic, GH-releasing and metabolic properties, is elevated in AN. We have previously shown that intervention with exogenous ghrelin is not effective in terms of inducing neuroendocrine and appetite responses in AN. In this arm of the same study protocol we investigated glucose metabolism responses to 5 h i.v. infusion of active ghrelin in a) 9 severely malnourished AN patients, b) 6 AN patients who partially recovered body weight (PRAN), c) 10 constitutionally thin female subjects with regular menstrual cycles. At baseline, no significant differences were observed in blood glucose, insulin, c-peptide, adiponectin, and homeostasis model assessment index values, between the studied groups. During ghrelin infusions, blood glucose levels significantly increased in all groups although significantly less in low-weight AN; insulin levels were not significantly affected, while c-peptide levels were significantly suppressed only in the constitutionally thin and PRAN subjects. In addition to our previous findings of impaired neuroendocrine and appetite responses in patients with AN, we conclude that metabolic responses to ghrelin are attenuated in these patients, which tend to recover with weight gain.","2007"

The study involved 360 well adults aged 16-49 years who had no known diagnosis of chronic disease. Two annual cycles of assessment, feedback workshops, action planning, and implementation of system changes. Assessment included a structured review of health service systems and an audit of clinical records. Adherence to guideline-scheduled preventive services including taking basic measurements, laboratory investigations, lifestyle counselling and pneumococcal vaccination. Of 12 preventive services measured, delivery of four services showed improvement over the study period: counselling on diet increased from 3% to 8% (P = 0.018); counselling on physical activity from 2% to 8% (P = 0.006); counselling on smoking from 2% to 11% (P = 0.003); and counselling on alcohol from 2% to 10% (P = 0.007). There was no improvement in important measures such as monitoring of waist circumference, blood pressure and blood glucose level, and delivery of pneumococcal vaccination. Our systems-oriented intervention was associated with some improvement in counselling activities, but no significant improvement in delivery of other preventive services. The main reason may be that implementation focused more on chronic illness management than preventive services for generally well adults.","2007"

The MetSyn was defined according to the Examination Committee of Criteria for ""Metabolic Syndrome"" in Japan. Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo(2max)) during a maximal cycling test was measured as an index of cardiorespiratory fitness at baseline and after the intervention. In the baseline examination, age- and BMI-adjusted odds ratios for MetSyn prevalence in the low, middle, and upper thirds of Vo(2max) were 1.0 (referent), 0.50 (95% confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.95), and 0.39 (95% confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.96), respectively (linear trend, p = 0.02). The adjusted odds ratios for MetSyn improvement in the two interventions with diet alone and diet plus exercise were 1.0 and 3.68 (95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 17.6; p = 0.04), respectively. These results suggest that adding aerobic exercise training to a dietary weight-reduction program further improves MetSyn (adjusted odds ratio, 3.68) in obese women, compared with diet alone.

A homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), area under the curve (AUC) of insulin after the glucose load, and plasma insulin level at 120 minutes after glucose loading (IRI 120) were used as an index of insulin resistance. The prevalence of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR >or=1.73) among oligomenorrheic women was 23.8%, which was significantly higher than that of eumenorrheic women, at 14.1%. The glucose AUCs (mean +/- SE) in the oligomenorrheal group (13,609 +/- 259 mg/min/dL) were similar to those for the normal menstrual groups (13,054 +/- 196 mg/min/dL), but the insulin AUCs of the oligomenorrheal group (5333 +/- 376 mU x min/L) were significantly higher than those of the normal menstrual groups (4517 +/- 266 mU x min/L).

Physical activity remains an important component of prevention and treatment for obesity, T2DM, and IR. Studies in adults show cardiovascular fitness (CVF) to be more important than obesity in predicting IR. We recently demonstrated that a school-based fitness intervention in children who were overweight can improve cardiovascular fitness, body composition, and insulin sensitivity, but it remains unclear whether accurate assessment of fitness could be performed at the school or outside of an exercise laboratory. The purpose of the study was to determine if a new methodology using measurement of cycling power could estimate cardiovascular aerobic fitness (as defined by maximum oxygen consumption; VO(2)max) in middle school children who were overweight. Thirty-five middle school children who were overweight (mean age 12 +/- 0.4 years) underwent testing on a power sensor- equipped Cycle Ops Indoor Cycle (IC), as well as body composition by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and VO(2)max by treadmill determination. Insulin sensitivity was also estimated by fasting glucose and insulin. Maximal heart rate (MHR) was determined during VO(2)max testing, and power produced at 80% of MHR was recorded. Spearman's rank correlation was performed to evaluate associations. Mean power determined on the IC at 80% of MHR was 129 +/- 77 watts, and average power at 80% MHR divided by total body weight (TBW) was 1.5 +/- 0.5. A significant correlation between watts/TBW was seen for VO(2)max (ml/kg/min) (p = 0.03), and significant negative correlation was seen between watts/TBW and fasting insulin (p < 0.05). In middle-school children who were overweight, there was a significant relationship between the power component of fitness and cardiovascular aerobic fitness (measured by VO(2)max). This more accessible and less intimidating field-based measure of power may prove useful in predicting changes in cardiovascular fitness. Thus, accurate assessment of childhood aerobic fitness may be achievable by measurement of power, possibly within the school environment at substantially less cost and effort than laboratory-based measurements.","2007"

Although anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), an inhibitor of follicle recruitment and maturation, is increased in women with PCOS, the usefulness of circulating AMH levels as a clinical predictor of menstrual response to weight loss in PCOS is not known. Overweight women with PCOS (n = 26, age 32.9 +/- 5.8 yr, weight 98.9 +/- 20.8 kg, body mass index 36.1 +/- 7.0 kg/m(2), mean +/- sd) followed an 8-wk weight loss and 6-month weight maintenance program.

Of 26 subjects, 15 (57.7%) responded to the intervention with improvements in menstrual cyclicity (responders). Compared to nonresponders, responders had lower AMH levels at baseline (23.6 +/- 12.0 vs. 37.9 +/- 17.8 pmol/liter; P = 0.021). Only responders had reductions in fasting insulin (6.1 +/- 5.9 mU/liter; P = 0.001) and homeostasis model assessment (1.3 +/- 5.9; P = 0.002) with acute weight loss (wk 0-8). Baseline AMH was most strongly predicted by baseline ghrelin, free testosterone, and insulin (r(2) = 0.528; P = 0.002). Overweight women with PCOS who respond to weight loss with menstrual improvements have significantly reduced preweight loss AMH and demonstrate improvements in surrogate measures of insulin resistance with weight loss. Pretreatment AMH is a potential clinical predictor of menstrual improvements with weight loss in PCOS.","2007"

The study utilized a multisite, control vs. intervention, repeated-measures design within four states in Australia. Fifty-six community pharmacies, 28 intervention and 28 control, were randomly selected from a representative sample of urban and rural areas. Intervention pharmacies delivered a diabetes service to patients with Type 2 diabetes, which comprised an ongoing cycle of assessment, management and review, provided at regular intervals over 6 months in the pharmacy. These services included support for self monitoring of blood glucose, education, adherence support, and reminders of checks for diabetes complications. Control pharmacists assessed patients at 0 and 6 months and delivered no intervention. A total of 289 subjects (149 intervention and 140 control) completed the study. For the intervention subjects, the mean blood glucose level decreased over the 6-month study from 9.4 to 8.5 mmol/l (P < 0.01). Furthermore, significantly greater improvements in glycaemic control were seen in the intervention group compared with the control: the mean reduction in HbA(1c) in the intervention group was -0.97% (95% CI: -0.8, -1.14) compared with -0.27% (95% CI: -0.15, -0.39) in the control group. Improvements were also seen in blood pressure control and quality of life in the intervention group. A pharmacy diabetes service model resulted in significant improvements in clinical and humanistic outcomes. Thus, community pharmacists can contribute significantly to improving care and health outcomes for patients with Type 2 diabetes.

There is an urgent need to understand how Indigenous primary care systems are organised to deliver diabetes services to those most in need, to monitor the quality of diabetes care received by Indigenous people, and to improve systems for better diabetes care. The intervention featured two annual cycles of assessment, feedback workshops, action planning, and implementation of system changes in 12 Indigenous community health centres. Assessment included a structured review of health service systems and audit of clinical records. Main process of care measures included adherence to guideline-scheduled services and medication adjustment. Main patient outcome measures were HbA1c, blood pressure and total cholesterol levels. There was good engagement of health centre staff, with significant improvements in system development over the study period. Adherence to guideline-scheduled processes improved, including increases in 6 monthly testing of HbA1c from 41% to 74% (Risk ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.71-2.10), 3 monthly checking of blood pressure from 63% to 76% (1.27, 1.13-1.37), annual testing of total cholesterol from 56% to 74% (1.36, 1.20-1.49), biennial eye checking by a ophthalmologist from 34% to 54% (1.68, 1.39-1.95), and 3 monthly feet checking from 20% to 58% (3.01, 2.52-3.47). Medication adjustment rates following identification of elevated HbA1c and blood pressure were low, increasing from 10% to 24%, and from 13% to 21% respectively at year 1 audit. However, improvements in medication adjustment were not maintained at the year 2 follow-up. Mean HbA1c value improved from 9.3 to 8.9% (mean difference -0.4%, 95% CI -0.7;-0.1), but there was no improvement in blood pressure or cholesterol control. This quality improvement (QI) intervention has proved to be highly acceptable in the Indigenous Australian primary care setting and has been associated with significant improvements in systems and processes of care and some intermediate outcomes. However, improvements appear to be limited by inadequate attention to abnormal clinical findings and medication management. Greater improvement in intermediate outcomes may be achieved by specifically addressing system barriers to therapy intensification through more effective engagement of medical staff in QI activities and/or greater use of nurse-practitioners.","2007"

Ghrelin, polypeptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were measured in the fasting state and postprandially in 12 healthy, normal-weight volunteers (six males and six females) using a randomised crossover design. One hour after a standardised breakfast, subjects either cycled for 60 min at 65% of their maximal heart rate or rested. Subjective appetite was assessed throughout the study using visual analogue scales and subsequent EI at a buffet meal was measured at the end (3-h post-breakfast and 1-h post-exercise). Exercise significantly increased mean PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels, and this effect was maintained during the post-exercise period for GLP-1 and PP. No significant effect of exercise was observed on postprandial levels of ghrelin. During the exercise period, hunger scores were significantly decreased; however, this effect disappeared in the post-exercise period. Exercise significantly increased subsequent absolute EI, but produced a significant decrease in relative EI after accounting for the energy expended during exercise. Hunger scores and PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels showed an inverse temporal pattern during the 1-h exercise/control intervention. In conclusion, acute exercise, of moderate intensity, temporarily decreased hunger sensations and was able to produce a short-term negative energy balance. This impact on appetite and subsequent energy homeostasis was not explained by changes in postprandial levels of ghrelin; however, 'exercise-induced anorexia' may potentially be linked to increased PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels.","2007"

Blood samples were taken before intervention, before cycling, after 5 min of cycling, and at exhaustion. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and P < 0.05 was regarded as significant. Caffeine significantly increased the concentration of plasma epinephrine (by 42%, 39%, and 49%), serum-free fatty acids (by 53%, 44%, and 50%), and plasma lactate (by 46%, 36%, and 48%), and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment-IR) (by 21%, 26%, and 23%) during rest, after 5 min of cycling, and at exhaustion. At exhaustion, the concentration plasma norepinephrine was elevated by 29%. A decrease was seen with caffeine treatment in blood potassium after 5 min of cycling and at exhaustion (by 3% and 2%, respectively). Caffeine treatment increased epinephrine, fatty acids, lactate and norepinephrine at different times during test session and led to insulin-resistance.

The objective of the study was to study the acute effects of bromocriptine (a D2R agonist) on circadian leptin levels in obese women, whereas body weight and caloric intake remained constant. This was a prospective, single-blind, crossover study (2004). The study was conducted at a clinical research center. Eighteen healthy obese women (body mass index 33.2 +/- 0.6 kg/m(2)) were studied twice in the early follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Treatment consisted of bromocriptine or placebo for 8 d. Blood was collected during 24 h at 20-min intervals for determination of leptin concentrations at the last day of medical treatment (bromocriptine or placebo). Mean 24-h serum concentrations were determined for insulin, glucose, free fatty acids, and triglycerides. Short-term treatment with bromocriptine reduced leptin concentration (placebo 33.6 +/- 2.5 vs. bromocriptine 30.5 +/- 2.5 ng/liter, P = 0.03). Free fatty acid concentrations were increased by treatment with bromocriptine. The increase of free fatty acids was inversely related with the decline of leptin levels. The decline of glucose, insulin, or prolactin concentrations in response to bromocriptine was not correlated with the reduction of leptin. Activation of dopamine D2 receptors by bromocriptine lowers circulating leptin levels in obese women, which suggests that dopaminergic neurotransmission is involved in the control of leptin release in humans.","2006"
"23074486","","Gastric electrical stimulation: an evidence-based analysis.","The objective of this analysis was to assess the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of gastric electrical stimulation (GES) for the treatment of chronic, symptomatic refractory gastroparesis and morbid obesity. GASTROPARESIS - EPIDEMIOLOGY: Gastroparesis (GP) broadly refers to impaired gastric emptying in the absence of obstruction. Clinically, this can range from the incidental detection of delayed gastric emptying in an asymptomatic person to patients with severe nausea, vomiting and malnutrition. Symptoms of GP are nonspecific and may mimic structural disorders such as ulcer disease, partial gastric or small bowel obstruction, gastric cancer, and pancreaticobiliary disorders. Gastroparesis may occur in association with diabetes, gastric surgery (consequence of peptic ulcer surgery and vagotomy) or for unknown reasons (idiopathic gastroparesis). Symptoms include early satiety, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and weight loss. The majority of patients with GP are women. The relationship between upper gastrointestinal symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying is considered to be weak. Some patients with markedly delayed gastric emptying are asymptomatic and sometimes, severe symptoms may remit spontaneously. Idiopathic GP may represent the most common form of GP. In one tertiary referral retrospective series, the etiologies in 146 GP patients were 36% idiopathic, 29% diabetic, 13% postgastric surgery, 7.5% Parkinson's disease, 4.8% collagen vascular disorders, 4.1% intestinal pseudoobstruction and 6% miscellaneous causes. The true prevalence of digestive symptoms in patients with diabetes and the relationship of these symptoms to delayed gastric emptying are unknown. Delayed gastric emptying is present in 27% to 58% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 30% with type 2 diabetes. However, highly variable rates of gastric emptying have been reported in type 1 and 2 diabetes, suggesting that development of GP in patients with diabetes is neither universal nor inevitable. In a review of studies examining gastric emptying in patients with diabetes compared to control patients, investigators noted that in many cases the magnitude of the delay in gastric emptying is modest. GP may occur as a complication of a number of different surgical procedures. For example, vagal nerve injury may occur in 4% to 40% of patients who undergo laparoscopic fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease. The prevalence of severe, refractory GP is scantily reported in the literature. Using data from a past study, it has been estimated that the prevalence of severe, symptomatic and refractory GP in the United States population is 0.017%. Assuming an Ontario population of 13 million, this would correspond to approximately 2,000 people in Ontario having severe, symptomatic, refractory GP. The incidence of severe refractory GP estimated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is approximately 4,000 per year in the United States. This corresponds to about 150 patients in Ontario. Using expert opinion and FDA data, the incidence of severe refractory GP in Ontario is estimated to be about 20 to 150 per year. To date, there have been no long-term studies confirming the beneficial effects of maintaining euglycemia on GP symptoms. However, it has been suggested that consistent findings of physiologic studies in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients provides an argument to strive for near-normal blood glucose levels in affected diabetes patients. Dietary measures (e.g., low fibre, low fat food), prokinetic drugs (e.g., domperidone, metoclopramide and erythromycin) and antiemetic or antinausea drugs (e.g, phenothiazines, diphenhydramine) are generally effective for symptomatic relief in the majority of patients with GP. For patients with chronic, symptomatic GP who are refractory to drug treatment, surgical options may include jejunostomy tube for feeding, gastrotomy tube for stomach decompression and pyloroplasty for gastric emptying. Few small studies examined the use of botulinum toxin injections into the pyloric sphincter. However, the contribution of excessive pyloric contraction to GP has been insufficiently defined and there have been no controlled studies of this therapy. Treatment with GES is reversible and may be a less invasive option compared to stomach surgery for the treatment of patients with chronic, drug-refractory nausea and vomiting secondary to GP. In theory, GES represents an intermediate step between treatment directed at the underlying pathophysiology, and the treatment of symptoms. It is based on studies of gastric electrical patterns in GP that have identified the presence of a variety of gastric arrhythmias. Similar to a cardiac pacemaker, it was hypothesized that GES could override the abnormal rhythms, stimulate gastric emptying and eliminate symptoms. Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of at last 30 kg/m(2). Morbid obesity is defined as a BMI of at least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions. Comorbid conditions associated with obesity include diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, obstructive sleep apnea, weight-related arthropathies, and stress urinary incontinence. In the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2)) for adults aged 20 years and older has increased significantly in the population, from 2.9% (1988-1994) to 4.7% (1999-2000). An expert estimated that about 160,000 to 180,000 people are morbidly obese in Ontario. Diet, exercise, and behavioural therapy are used to help people lose weight. Bariatric surgery for morbid obesity is considered an intervention of last resort for patients who have attempted first-line forms of medical management. Gastric stimulation has been investigated for the treatment of morbid obesity; the intention being to reduce appetite and induce early satiety possibly due to inhibitory effects on gastric motility and effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and hormones related to satiety and/or appetite. Possible advantages to GES for the treatment of morbid obesity include reversibility of the procedure, less invasiveness than some bariatric procedures, e.g., gastric bypass, and less side effects (e.g., dumping syndrome). Electrical stimulation is delivered via an implanted system that consists of a neurostimulator and 2 leads. The surgical procedure can be performed via either an open or laparoscopic approach. An external programmer used by the physician can deliver instructions to the GES, i.e., adjust the rate and amplitude of stimulation (Figure 1). GES may be turned off by the physician at any time or may be removed. The battery life is approximately 4-5 years For treatment of GP, the GES leads are secured in the muscle of the lower stomach, 10 cm proximal to the pylorus (the opening from the stomach to the intestine), 1 cm apart and connected to an implantable battery-powered neurostimulator which is placed in a small pocket in the abdominal wall For treatment of morbid obesity, GES leads are implanted along the lesser curvature of the stomach where the vagal nerve branches spread, approximately 8 cm proximal to the pylorus. However, the implant positioning of the leads has been variably reported in the literature. The Enterra Therapy System and the Transcend II Implantable Gastric Stimulation System (Medtronic Inc.) are both licensed as class 3 devices by Health Canada (license numbers 60264 and 66948 respectively). The Health Canada indications for use are: ENTERRA THERAPY SYSTEM: ""For use in the treatment of chronic intractable (drug-refractory) nausea and vomiting."" ""For use in weight reduction for obese adults with a body mass index greater than 35.""The GES device that is licensed by Health Canada for treatment of GP, produces high-frequency GES. Most clinical studies examining GES for GP have used high-frequency (4 times the intrinsic slow wave frequency, i.e., 12 cycles per minute), low energy, short duration pulses. This type of stimulation does not alter gastric muscular contraction and has no effect on slow wave dysrhythmias. The mechanism of action is unclear but it is hypothesized that high-frequency GES may act on sensory fibers directed to the CNS. The GES device licensed by Health Canada for treatment of morbid obesity produces low-frequency GES, which is close to or just above the normal/native gastric slow wave cycle (approximately 3 cycles/min.). This pacing uses low-frequency, high-energy, long-duration pulses to induce propagated slow waves that replace the spontaneous ones. Low-frequency pacing does not invoke muscular contractions. Most studies examining the use of GES for the treatment of morbid obesity use low-frequency GES. Under normal circumstances, the gastric slow wave propagates distally and determines the frequency and propagation direction of gastric peristalsis. Low-frequency GES aims to produce abnormal gastric slow waves that can induce gastric dysrhythmia, disrupt regular propagation of slow waves, cause hypomotility of the stomach, delay gastric emptying, reduce food intake, prolong satiety, and produce weight loss. In the United States, the Enterra Therapy System is a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD), meaning it is a medical device designated by the FDA for use in the treatment of medical conditions that affect fewer than 4,000 individuals per year. The Enterra Therapy System is indicated for ""the treatment of chronic, drug- refractory nausea and vomiting secondary to GP of diabetes or idiopathic etiology"" (not postsurgical etiologies). GES for morbid obesity has not been approved by the FDA and is for investigational use only in the United States. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)","2006"
"15994239","Braun Barry; Gerson Laura; Hagobian Todd; Grow Daniel; Chipkin Stuart R","No effect of short-term testosterone manipulation on exercise substrate metabolism in men.","Compared with women, men use proportionately more carbohydrate and less fat during exercise at the same relative intensity. Estrogen and progesterone have potent effects on substrate use during exercise in women, but the role of testosterone (T) in mediating substrate use is unknown. The purpose of this investigation was to assess how large variations in the concentration of blood T would impact substrate use during exercise in men. Nine healthy, active men were studied in three distinct hormonal conditions: physiological T (no intervention), low T (pharmacological suppression of endogenous T with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist), and high T (supplementation with transdermal T). Total carbohydrate oxidation, blood glucose rate of disappearance, and estimated muscle glycogen use were assessed by using stable isotope dilution and indirect calorimetry at rest and while bicycling at approximately 60% of peak O2 consumption for 90 min. Relative to the physiological condition (T = 5.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml), total plasma T was considerably suppressed in low T (0.8 +/- 0.1) and elevated in high T (10.9 +/- 1.1). Despite the large changes in plasma T, carbohydrate oxidation, glucose rate of disappearance, and estimated muscle glycogen use were very similar across the three conditions. There were also no differences in plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, lactate, or free fatty acids. Plasma estradiol (E) concentrations were elevated in high T, but correlations between substrate use and plasma concentrations of T, E, or the T-to-E ratio were very weak (r2 < 0.20). In conclusion, unlike the effect of acute elevation in E to constrain carbohydrate use in women, acute changes in circulating T concentrations do not appear to alter substrate use during exercise in men.","2005"

An i.v.GTT was performed before and after a standardized training program in 316 women and 280 men (173 blacks and 423 whites). Participants exercised on cycle ergometers 3 days per week for 60 sessions. The exercise intensity was progressively increased from 55% VO2max for 30 min per session to 75% VO2max for 50 min per session. Mean insulin sensitivity increased by 10% (P < 0.001) following the intervention, but the variability in the changes was high. Men had larger improvements than women (P = 0.02). Improvements in fasting insulin were transitory, disappearing 72 h after the last bout of exercise. There were also significant mean increases in the glucose disappearance index (3%, P = 0.02) and in glucose effectiveness (11%, P < 0.001), measures of glucose tolerance and of the capacity of glucose to mediate its own disposal, respectively. The acute insulin response to glucose, a measure of insulin secretion, increased by 7% in the quartile with the lowest baseline glucose tolerance and decreased by 14% in the quartile with the highest baseline glucose tolerance (P < 0.001). The glucose area below fasting levels during the i.v.GTT was reduced by 7% (P = 0.02). Although the effects of structured regular exercise were highly variable, there were improvements in virtually all i.v.GTT-derived variables. In the absence of substantial weight loss, regular exercise is required for sustained improvements in glucose homeostasis.","2005"

We studied whether training changes beta-cell function in type 2 diabetic patients. Patients, stratified into ""moderate"" and ""low"" secretors according to individual C-peptide responses to an intravenous glucagon test, were randomly assigned to a training program [ergometer cycling 30-40 min/day, including at least 20 min at 75% maximum oxygen consumption (Vo(2 max)), 5 days/wk for 3 mo] or a sedentary schedule. Before and after the intervention (16 h after last training bout), a sequential hyperglycemic (90 min at 11, 18, and 25 mM) clamp was performed. An intravenous bolus of 5 g of arginine was given at the end. Training increased Vo(2 max) 17 +/- 13% and decreased heart rate during submaximal exercise (P < 0.05). During the 3 mo of sedentary lifestyle, insulin and C-peptide responses to the clamp procedures were unchanged in both moderate and low secretors. Likewise, no change in beta-cell response was seen after training in the low secretors (n = 5). In contrast, moderate secretors (n = 9) showed significant increases in beta-cell responses to 18 and 25 mM hyperglycemia and to arginine stimulation. Glucagon responses to arginine as well as measures of insulin sensitivity and Hb A(1c) levels were not altered by training. In conclusion, in type 2 diabetic patients, training may enhance beta-cell function if the remaining secretory capacity is moderate but not if it is low. The improved beta-cell function does not require changes in insulin sensitivity and Hb A(1c) concentration.","2004"

Ultrasound examinations and Ferriman-Gallwey scoring were also performed. Measurements of plasma LH, FSH, estradiol (E(2)), androstenedione (A), 17-hydroxy-progesterone (17-OHP), and testosterone (T), glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations. After 6 months of metformin administration, the plasma LH, 17-OHP, A, and T levels and LH/FSH ratio were significantly reduced. Insulin sensitivity, expressed as the glucose-to-insulin ratio, was significantly improved under glucose load after 6 months of treatment. Spontaneous LH episodic release showed a significant reduction in pulse amplitude with no changes in pulse frequency. Menstrual cyclicity was restored in all amenorrheic and oligomenorrheic women. The ovarian volume and Ferriman-Gallwey scores also were significantly reduced. Metformin administration improves reproductive axis functioning in hyperandrogenic nonobese PCOS patients.

North Staffordshire Hospitals NHS Trust. 20 healthy young menstruating women, aged (mean +/- SEM) 34 +/- 1 years, with normal menstruation, defined as a menstrual cycle of 21-35 days were studied at 3 time points of the same menstrual cycle. First in the early follicular phase (M-phase), at mid-follicular phase (F-phase), and during the luteal phase (L-phase). none. serum levels of soluble E-selectin, ICAM-1, plasma homocysteine, vitamin E and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as lipoprotein fractions were measured at each time points. The mean percentage change for E-selectin between the M-phase and L-phase, F-phase and L-phase were 6% and 4%, respectively, p<0.005, p<0.066. Levels of ICAM-1, vitamin E and malondialdehyde did not vary through the cycle. Homocysteine was not different between M-phase and F-phase (10.39 +/- 0.68 micromol/l vs 10.33 +/- 0.65), nor between M-phase and L-phase (10.39+/-0.68 vs 9.77 +/- 0.75 micromol/l). Although the mean percentage decrease in homocysteine between F- and L-phases was significant (5.36 +/- 0.53%, p=0.029), the absolute decrease in concentrations was not (p=0.07). There were no cyclical changes in total, LDL, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apo A-I, apo B or Lp(a). Using a linear regression model, after correction for age, smoking, body mass index (BMI) and waist/hip ratio (WHR), oestrogen levels were the only predictor of E-selectin during the L-phase p<0.005. There were no significant correlations between oestrogen with lipids, apolipoproteins or homocysteine. There was an interesting significant univariate correlation between homocysteine with low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apo B throughout all phases of the cycle, which persisted after correction for the effects of age, BMI, WHR and smoking history. Multiple regression analysis with all these factors showed homocysteine to be a significant predictor of apo B concentration during M (p=0.030) and L-phases (p=0.023) of the cycle and of LDL cholesterol in the M-phase (p=0.033). Female sex hormones may have small, though significant modulating role on E-selectin and homocysteine metabolism in healthy premenopausal women. Furthermore, the correlation between homocysteine, LDL and apo B levels suggests that induction of cholesterol synthesis by homocysteine, shown previously in vitro, may be of relevance in vivo.","2003"

For 6 days, subjects consumed a random order of a high-fat (69% fat; FAT-adapt) or a high-CHO (70% CHO; HCHO) diet, each followed by 1 day of a high-CHO diet. Treatments were separated by an 18-day wash out. Substrate oxidation was determined during submaximal cycling (20 min at 65% VO(2peak)) prior to and following the 6 day dietary interventions. Fat oxidation at baseline was not different between treatments (17.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 16.1 +/- 1.3 g x 20 min(-1) for FAT-adapt and HCHO, respectively) but increased 34% after 6 days of FAT-adapt (to 23.3 +/- 0.9 g x 20 min(-1), p < .05) and decreased 30% after HCHO (to 11.3 +/- 1.4 g x 20 min(-1), p < .05). Glucose tolerance, determined by the area under the plasma [glucose] versus time curve during an oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) test, was similar at baseline (545 +/- 21 vs. 520 +/- 28 mmol x L(-1) x 90 min(-1)), after 5-d of dietary intervention (563 +/- 26 vs. 520 +/-18 mmol x L(-1) x 90 min(-1)) and after 1 d of high-CHO (491 +/- 28 vs. 489 +/- 22 mmol x L(-1) x 90 min(-1) for FAT- adapt and HCHO, respectively). An index of whole-body insulin sensitivity ( S(I), 10000/divided by fasting [glucose] x fasting [insulin] x mean [glucose] during OGTT x mean [insulin] during OGTT) was similar at baseline (15 +/- 2 vs. 17 +/- 5 arbitrary units), after 5-d of dietary intervention (15 +/- 2 vs. 15 +/- 2) and after 24 h of CHO loading (17 +/- 3 vs. 18 +/- 2 for FAT- adapt and HCHO, respectively). We conclude that despite marked changes in the pattern of substrate oxidation during submaximal exercise, short-term adaptation to a high-fat diet does not alter whole-body glucose tolerance or an index of insulin sensitivity in highly-trained individuals.","2001"

Detrimental effects of prolonged ischemia can be attenuated by preconditioning, however, relatively little is known about its effects in the diseased myocardium. This study was designed to test the susceptibility to ischemia-induced arrhythmias and the effect of preconditioning in the diabetic heart. Rats were made diabetic with streptozotocin (45 mg/kg, i.v.). After 1 week, isolated Langendorff-perfused hearts were subjected to 30 min occlusion of LAD coronary artery without or with preceding preconditioning induced by one cycle of 5 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion. Glycogen and lactate contents were estimated in the preconditioned and non-preconditioned hearts before and after ischemia. Diabetic hearts were more resistant to ischemia-induced arrhythmias: incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) decreased to 42% and only transient ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred in 17% of the hearts as compared to the non-diabetic controls (VT 100% and VF 70% including sustained VF 36%; p < 0.05). Preconditioning effectively suppressed the incidence and severity of arrhythmias (VT 33%, VF 0%) in the normal hearts. However, this intervention did not confer any additional protection in the diabetic hearts. Despite higher glycogen content in the diabetic myocardium and greater glycogenolysis during ischemia, production of lactate in these hearts was significantly lower than in the controls. Preconditioning caused a substantial decrease in the accumulation of lactate in the normal hearts, whereby in the diabetic hearts, this intervention did not cause any further reduction in the level of lactate. In conclusion, diabetic rat hearts exhibit lower susceptibility to ischemic injury and show no additional response to preconditioning. Reduced production of glycolytic metabolites during ischemia can account for the enhanced resistance of diabetic hearts to ischemia as well as for the lack of further protection by preconditioning.","2000"

Each subject with PCOS or IH was assigned randomly to receive either flutamide tablets (250 mg twice a day) or placebo for > or =5 months. Twelve subjects (6 with PCOS, 6 with IH) received flutamide and 10 (5 with PCOS, 5 with IH) received placebo. All subjects ingested 75 g of glucose and then underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), 3-7 days after spontaneous or medroxyprogesterone acetate (5 mg daily for 5 days)-induced menses. In women with PCOS or IH, the OGTT was repeated at the fourth month of treatment. Fasting and OGTT-stimulated levels of glucose, insulin, and C peptide. Both fasting and OGTT-stimulated levels of insulin and C peptide were significantly higher in women with PCOS and in those with IH than in controls. Placebo did not modify parameters of glucose metabolism. Flutamide was capable of significantly blunting fasting and OGTT-stimulated secretion of insulin only in women with IH. Hyperinsulinemia exists in women with IH as well as in nonobese women with PCOS. Treatment with flutamide can completely reverse hyperinsulinemia only in women with IH, which suggests that the efficacy of the drug is dependent on peripheral androgen hyperactivity.","1999"

Eighteen healthy, young, untrained men and women participated in a 4-week, five times per week, 1-h per session bicycle-ergometer training program. Training consisted of 3-min bouts of cycling interspersed with 2 min at a lower exercise intensity. Intensities were 80 and 40% of pretraining maximal power output (W(max)) in the high-intensity (HI) and 40 and 20% W(max) in the low-intensity (LI) group. The insulin sensitivity index (IS(index)) was similar in the HI and LI group before the training intervention [mean (SD) -0.1898 (0.058) and -0.1892 (0.045), respectively]. After training, the IS(index) was -0.2358 (0.051) (P = 0.005 vs pretraining) in the HI group and -0.2050 (0.035) (P = 0. 099 against pretraining) in the LI group. We conclude that improvements in insulin sensitivity are more pronounced with high-intensity training, when exercise frequency and duration are kept similar. We further conclude that the ITT is suitable for use in intervention studies.","1999"

Care and outcome were assessed in 505 (1995) and 604 (1996) Type 2 diabetic patients. The first audit cycle showed that defined standards were not met for several criteria and also revealed a lack of standardisation of HbA1c measurements and delayed intervention when blood glucose control was inadequate. Corrective measures were adopted: cooperative protocols for foot care, prevention of nephropathy and retinopathy, standardisation of HbA1c, and an educational programme at the primary health care level. The second audit cycle showed improvement in foot care (+33.6%), quality (+39.9%), prescription of HbA1c (+11.9%), and control of blood pressure (+11.9%) and blood lipids (+12.8%). The proportion of early interventions in case of inadequate glucose control increased significantly (+10.5%). However, some gaps persisted, mainly regarding screening for complications, diet counselling and patient education. This study shows that cooperation between general practitioners and diabetes specialists is feasible and effective in the context of a district-wide approach, and that it facilitates the adoption of international guidelines by local physicians.

Free-standing, outpatient dialysis center with an average of 130 patients on staff-assisted hemodialysis. Data were collected on 16 patients who completed 3 months in the program, 6 patients who completed 6 months in the program, and 4 patients who completed 12 months in the program. Patients participated in a progressive, self-paced exercise program including cycling before or during hemodialysis, or walking on a treadmill before hemodialysis. In addition to this, patients also had the option of doing stretching and/or light weight exercises during hemodialysis. Performance tests included 60-second sit-stand, 28-ft slow and brisk walk, 60-second stair climb, and 60-second leg lifts. Nutrition assessment included changes in estimated dry weight, hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum glucose, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, Kt/V, normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), average monthly interdialytic weight gain, and monthly mean predialysis and postdialysis blood pressure. Glycohemoglobin was assessed in diabetic patients. Patients' charts were reviewed for episodes of intradialytic cramping and hypotension. All patients showed improvement in measures of physical performance at 3, 6, and 12 months. Mean phosphorus decreased from 1.94 +/- 0.45 mmol (6.02 +/- 1.4 mg/dL) by 11% at 3 months (P = 0.05) and by 26% at 12 months (P < 0.02). Patients who exercised for 12 months experienced a mean 16% reduction in blood glucose. Mean glucose levels for 7 diabetic patients decreased from 12.35 +/- 5.8 mmol/L (224.1 +/- 105) to 11. 66 +/- 1.9 mmol/L (211.7 +/- 34 mg/dL); however, this was not statistically significant. Mean glycohemoglobin levels for diabetic patients did not change significantly. Increases were seen in Kt/V, estimated dry weight, and serum albumin; however, these were not statistically significant. Decreases were noted in mean predialysis and postdialysis blood pressures and average interdialytic weight gains at 3, 6, and 12 months. A formal intradialytic exercise regimen can produce objective evidence of improvement in physical performance and some measures of nutritional well-being over 3 to 12 months. Further research is needed to determine if these changes are a result of exercise alone or increased compliance with the medical and dietary regimen.","1999"

Serum GH, IGF-1, IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), insulin, glucose, total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, E2, and gonadotropin levels. Basal and ACTH-stimulated steroid precursors were measured. Patients with idiopathic hirsutism were identified by normal serum androgen levels (n=17). Those with functional ovarian hyperandrogenism (n=15) were identified by an increase in the serum testosterone level that normalized during gonadal suppression, whereas those with functional adrenal hyperandrogenism (n=8) were identified by an initial increase in the testosterone level that persisted during gonadal suppression. The adrenal hyperandrogenism group had increased IGF-1 levels compared with the control, idiopathic hirsutism, and ovarian hyperandrogenism groups. Patients with ovarian hyperandrogenism had normal TGF-1 concentrations, but their IGFBP-3 concentrations were lower than those of controls. No differences were observed in GH levels between any of the groups. These results persisted when the influence of age was corrected for. The IGF-1 axis appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of hyperandrogenism, especially in patients with adrenal hyperandrogenism, who have a clear increase in IGF-1 levels. Moreover, patients with ovarian hirsutism have decreased IGFBP-3 concentrations, which might enhance IGF-1 bioavailability.","1998"

The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism involved in animal survival despite significantly enhanced liver injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (175-225 g) were treated with isopropanol (ISOP, 2.5 ml/kg, 25% aqueous solution, po) 24 hr prior to CCl4 (1 ml/kg, ip) administration. Plasma enzymes (ALT and SDH), hepatic glycogen levels, and [3H]thymidine (3H-T) incorporation into hepatonuclear DNA were measured during a time course (0-96 hr) after CCl4 administration. Liver sections were examined for histopathology and cell cycle progression by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry. Maximum injury was observed at 36 hr in both the groups as indicated by elevated plasma enzyme levels and by histopathology. The extent of injury in the ISOP + CCl4 group was higher than that in the H2O + CCl4 group. Plasma enzyme activity returned to control levels by 60 hr, indicating recovery from injury in both groups. Maximum 3H-T incorporation occurred at 48 hr in both groups (ISOP + CCl4; vehicle + CCl4), indicating maximum stimulation of S-phase synthesis. PCNA studies revealed a corresponding stimulation of cell cycle progression. The wave of S-phase synthesis and cell cycle progression returned to control levels in the H2O + CCl4 group by 60 hr but continued up to 72 hr in the ISOP + CCl4 group. These findings support the hypothesis that in response to increased infliction of CCl4 injury by isopropanol, augmented stimulation of cell division and tissue repair restrain the progression of injury and restore hepatic structure and function, thereby allowing the rats to survive. Further, antimitotic intervention with colchicine (1 mg/kg, ip) led to decreased S-phase synthesis, followed by 60% lethality in the isopropanol-pretreated group in contrast to 40% lethality in the group receiving CCl4 alone (H2O + CCl4). These findings suggest that greater stimulation of tissue repair restrains the progression of ISOP-enhanced infliction of CCl4 liver injury and accounts for recovery from enhanced liver injury and animal survival. The findings are consistent with a two-stage model of toxicity wherein liver injury is linked by progression or regression of injury, which is governed by the extent of tissue repair to the final outcome.","1996"

The hyperglycemia increases in recovery and is accompanied by hyperinsulinemia. Because these adaptations are unique to intense exercise, we tested the physiological significance of the hyperinsulinemia by exercising six fit, postabsorptive young male subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) after overnight glycemic normalization by iv insulin, keeping its infusion rate constant during and for 2 h after 100% maximum VO2 cycle ergometer exercise to exhaustion (12 min) (no postexercise hyperinsulinemia). Their responses were compared with those of matched control subjects studied on two separate occasions, once without intervention (physiological hyperinsulinemia, n = 6) and again with a 0.05 U/kg iv bolus at exhaustion (postexercise supraphysiological hyperinsulinemia, n = 5). In all three study protocols, Ra increased by 7-fold, and Rd by 4-fold at exhaustion, and Ra declined in early recovery at the same rates. Therefore, the early recovery hyperinsulinemia is not required to return Ra to preexercise levels, and excessive hyperinsulinemia does not accelerate this decline. We infer that the catecholamine increments and decrements are the prime regulators of Ra (correlations of Ra vs. norepinephrine or epinephrine, P < 0.001 in the three studies), with a smaller contribution from the concurrent hyperglucagonemia. Rd, in contrast, was significantly affected by insulin. In the IDDM subjects, Rd remained at the same rate as Ra through most of recovery, resulting in sustained hyperglycemia and decreased glucose MCR, vs. the control subjects. This hyperglycemia compensated for the abnormal MCR, such that Rd was comparable to that in the control subjects. With the insulin bolus, the Rd elevation was sustained longer compared to the study without bolus, resulting in mild hypoglycemia successfully counterregulated by an increase in Ra. Thus, the principal regulators of the marked exercise increase and rapid recovery decrease in Ra are probably the catecholamines. The postexercise hyperinsulinemia is required for the MCR response and to return plasma glucose concentrations to preexercise levels. Different therapeutic strategies are required in persons with IDDM undergoing strenuous vs. moderate exercise, because of their inability to generate the postexercise hyperinsulinemia.","1993"
