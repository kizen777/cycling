However, due to the exercise intensity causing high-perceived exertion, the participants often do not wish to continue the training. The 10-20-30 training concept consists of low intensity for 30 s, 20 s at a moderate pace, and then 10 s with high intensity either running or cycling. A 10-20-30 training session consist of two to four 5-min blocks. The 10-20-30 training improved fitness and performance as well as lowered blood pressure and body fat of both untrained and trained individuals even with a significant reduction in the training volume. Similarly, hypertensive, diabetic, and asthmatic patients lowered body fat, improved fitness, and performance during a 10-20-30-training intervention period. In addition, hypertensive patients reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure markedly with the 10-20-30 training twice a week for 8 weeks. Diabetic patients lowered long-term blood sugar (HbA1c), which did not occur with moderate-intensity exercise training. Furthermore, asthmatic patients improved their control of asthma and asthma-related quality of life with the 10-20-30 training. The adherence for the patient groups was high (>80%), and no adverse events were reported. Thus, the 10-20-30 training seems to be time efficient and feasible for untrained and trained individuals as well as patients and may be used in the prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases.",2024,NA

Based on the median of FBG (4.97 mmol/L, 1 mmol/L = 18 mg/dL), the subjects were categorized into the low-normal group (3.90 ≤ FBG ≤ 4.97 mmol/L, n = 472) and the high-normal group (4.97 < FBG < 6.10 mmol/L, n = 472). Multivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were used to analyze the relationship between high-normal FBG and ART outcomes. live birth rate (LBR). LBR was significantly lower in the high-normal group than in the low-normal group (36.8% vs. 45.1%, p = 0.010), and the miscarriage rate was considerably higher than that in the low-normal group (23.9% vs. 16.5%, p = 0.041). High-normal FBG of female was an independent predictor of live birth (adjusted OR:0.747, 95% CI: 0.541-0.963, p = 0.027) and miscarriage (adjusted OR:1.610, 95% CI: 1.018-2.547, p = 0.042). ROC analyses showed that the cut-off values of FBG (endpoints: live birth and miscarriage) were 5.07 mmol/L, and 5.01 mmol/L, respectively. In women with normal BMI, high-normal FBG is an independent risk factor for lower LBR and higher miscarriage rate in single blastocyst FET cycles. Attention to preconception FBG monitoring in this particular population may allow early intervention to improve ART outcomes.",2024,NA

However, new primary studies on the topic have recently been published, and the respective meta-analytic evidence needs to be updated. To systematically review, summarise and appraise evidence on physical health benefits of participation in different recreational sports. Searches for journal articles were conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, SpoLit, SPORTDiscus, Sports Medicine & Education Index and Web of Science. We included longitudinal and intervention studies investigating physical health outcomes associated with participation in a given sport among generally healthy adults without disability. A total of 136 papers from 76 studies conducted among 2.6 million participants were included in the review. Our meta-analyses of available evidence found that: (1) cycling reduces the risk of coronary heart disease by 16% (pooled hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80, 0.89), all-cause mortality by 21% (HR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.84), cancer mortality by 10% (HR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.96) and cardiovascular mortality by 20% (HR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.86); (2) football has favourable effects on body composition, blood lipids, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, cardiovascular function at rest, cardiorespiratory fitness and bone strength (p < 0.050); (3) handball has favourable effects on body composition and cardiorespiratory fitness (p < 0.050); (4) running reduces the risk of all-cause mortality by 23% (HR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.85), cancer mortality by 20% (HR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.89) and cardiovascular mortality by 27% (HR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.94) and improves body composition, cardiovascular function at rest and cardiorespiratory fitness (p < 0.010); and (5) swimming reduces the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.92) and improves body composition and blood lipids (p < 0.010).

Sixteen participants conducted three aerobic exercise sessions (maximum 75 min) in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. Thirty minutes before exercise, participants ingested a drink containing either 250 mg of caffeine + 10 g of glucose + aspartame (CAF), 10 g of glucose + aspartame (GLU), or aspartame alone (ASP). The primary outcome was time to hypoglycaemia. There was a significant effect of the condition on time to hypoglycaemia (χ2 = 7.674, p = .0216). Pairwise comparisons revealed an 85.7% risk reduction of hypoglycaemia for CAF compared with ASP (p = .044). No difference was observed between GLU and ASP (p = .104) or between CAF and GLU (p = .77). While CAF increased glucose levels during exercise compared with GLU and ASP (8.3 ± 1.9 mmol/L vs. 7.7 ± 2.2 mmol/L vs. 5.8 ± 1.4 mmol/L; p < .001), peak plasma glucose levels during exercise did not differ between CAF and GLU (9.3 ± 1.4 mmol/L and 9.1 ± 1.6 mmol/L, p = .80), but were higher than in ASP (6.6 ± 1.1 mmol/L; p < .001). The difference in glucose levels between CAF and GLU was largest during the last 15 min of exercise (p = .002). Compared with GLU, CAF lowered perceived exertion (p = .023).

SJL leads to chronic circadian rhythm disruption and may affect nearly 70% of the general population, leading to increased risk for cardiometabolic diseases. This study investigated the effects of SJL on metabolic health, exercise performance, and exercise-induced skeletal muscle adaptations in mice. Ten-week-old C57BL/6J mice (n = 40) were allocated to four groups: control sedentary (CON-SED), control exercise (CON-EX), social jet lag sedentary (SJL-SED), and social jet lag exercise (SJL-EX). CON mice were housed under a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. SJL was simulated by implementing a 4-h phase delay for 3 days to simulate ""weekends,"" followed by a 4-h phase advance back to ""weekdays,"" for 6 wk. EX mice had free access to a running wheel. Graded exercise tests (GXTs) and glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) were performed at baseline and after intervention to monitor the effects of exercise and social jet lag on cardiorespiratory and metabolic health, respectively. SJL led to alterations in activity and running patterns and clock gene expression in skeletal muscle and decreased average running distance (P < 0.05). SJL-SED mice gained significantly more weight compared with CON-SED and SJL-EX mice (P < 0.01). SJL impaired fasting blood glucose and glucose tolerance compared with CON mice (P < 0.05), which was partially restored by exercise in SJL-EX mice. SJL also blunted improvements in exercise performance and mitochondrial content in the quadriceps. These data suggest that SJL blunted some cardiometabolic adaptations to exercise and that proper circadian hygiene is necessary for maintaining health and performance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In mice, disrupting circadian rhythms with social jet lag for 6 wk caused significant weight gain, higher fasting blood glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance compared with control. Voluntary exercise in mice experiencing social jet lag prevented weight gain, though the mice still experienced increased fasting blood glucose and impaired exercise performance compared with trained mice not experiencing social jet lag. Social jet lag seems to be a potent circadian rhythm disruptor that impacts exercise-induced training adaptations.",2024,NA

FDX1 is a ferredoxin-reducing protein on human mitochondria that plays an important role in steroid anabolism. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for PCOS. Recent studies have suggested that FDX1 may be associated with the development of PCOS. This study aims to explore the pivotal role of FDX1 in the amelioration of PCOS through liraglutide intervention. A PCOS rat model was induced via subcutaneous DHEA injections. Following successful model establishment, the rats were treated with liraglutide combined with metformin, or with each drug individually, over a six-week period. After 6 weeks of treatment, we assessed changes in body weight, fasting blood glucose, sex hormone levels, estrous cycle regularity, ovarian morphology, FDX1 expression in ovarian tissue, and ovarian ROS levels. PCOS rats exhibited significant increases in body weight and fasting blood glucose levels, disrupted estrous cycles, and polycystic ovarian morphology. FDX1 expression was notably reduced in the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. Treatment with liraglutide, both alone and in combination with metformin, led to improvements in body weight, fasting blood glucose, sex hormone balance, estrous cycle regularity, ovarian morphology, and ovarian ROS levels. Notably, FDX1 expression was significantly restored in all treatment groups, with the most substantial increase observed in the liraglutide-treated group. This study suggests that FDX1 could serve as a potential biomarker for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of liraglutide's therapeutic effects in PCOS management.",2024,NA

Although the advantages of proper glycaemic control in hospitalised patients with diabetes are well established, a variety of barriers limit accomplishment of blood glucose targets. Our primary aim was to decrease the number of glucose values above 180 mg/dL in non-critical care hospitalised patients using an audit and feedback intervention with pharmacy and internal medicine residents. A resident-led multidisciplinary team implemented the quality improvement (QI) project including conception, literature review, educating residents, iterative development of audit and feedback tools and data analysis. The multidisciplinary team met every 5 weeks and undertook three 'plan-do-study-act' cycles over an 8-month intervention period (August 2022 to March 2023) to educate residents on inpatient hyperglycaemia management, develop and implement an audit and feedback process and assess areas for improvement. We performed 1045 audits analysing 16 095 accu-checks on 395 non-duplicated patients. Most audits showed compliance with guidelines. The monthly run-on chart shows per cent of glucose values above 180 mg/dL in our non-ICU hospitalised patients and an overall pre-to-post comparison of 25.1%-23.0% (p value<0.05). The intervention was well accepted by residents evidenced by survey results. We did not meet our primary aim to reduce hyperglycaemia by 30% and this combined with the audits showing mostly compliance with guidelines suggests that prescribing behaviour was not a key driver of inpatient hyperglycaemia in our population. This internal medicine resident and pharmacy interprofessional collaboration with audit and feedback for inpatient hyperglycaemia was feasible, well accepted and had a statistically significant yet small improvement in inpatient hyperglycaemia. The project may be helpful to others wishing to explore inpatient hyperglycaemia, interprofessional QI with pharmacists, resident-led QI and audit and feedback.",2024,NA

Healthy, physically active 20-28 year olds, were randomly assigned to either experimental (EXP, N = 11) or non-training control (CON, N = 8) group. With supervision, the EXP group performed one bout of 30-s sprint-cycle daily, Mondays to Fridays over 6 weeks, while CON group continued with their usual lifestyle. The followings were measured at pre- and post-intervention: maximal aerobic power, peak torque of knee extensors and flexors at velocities 30° s-1 and 300° s-1, resting heart rate, resting blood pressure, body fat percentage, fasting lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, and fasting insulin levels. There were no significant improvements in the EXP group for all the measured variables (all P > 0.05); except for significant interaction effects in peak torque of knee extensors at 30° s-1 (P = 0.044) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P = 0.046). Post hoc test indicate that CON group showed decline in their low-density lipo-proteins levels (P = 0.024). Six weeks of one all-out bout of 30-s sprint-cycle per day, for 5 consecutive days per week, was ineffective in improving cardiovascular fitness, maximal strength, and most health markers in physically active young adults.

The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of melatonin in alleviating PCOS-induced alterations in female Wistar rats. PCOS was induced in female albino rats by administering letrozole at a dose of 1 mg/kg for 21 days. A total of 24 rats were randomly selected and divided into four groups: group I (normal control), group II (melatonin treatment), group III (letrozole treatment), and group IV (melatonin therapy for PCOS rats). Physical parameters (body and uterus weight), hormone profile (LH and FSH), and steroidogenic enzyme activities and an oral glucose test were assessed using standard methods. Histological analysis was performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The results demonstrated that exogenous melatonin administration significantly improved PCOS symptoms in rats, including reduced body weight gain, changes in organ weight/body weight index, blood glucose level, percentage diestrus phase, testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and LH/FSH ratio, as well as 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD enzyme activity. Histopathological findings revealed well-developed follicles, decreased cystic follicles, and increased antral follicles, Graafian follicles, and corpus luteum in PCOS rats treated with melatonin. These positive outcomes suggest that exogenous melatonin may hold promise as a valuable remedy for PCOS conditions in female rats.

Astragalus polysaccharide (APS)-as a water-soluble heteropolysaccharide-can lower blood sugar and lipid and exert anti-aging effects and thus has been proven to be beneficial to various types of metabolic diseases. However, specific mechanisms of the action of APS on PCOS are yet to be studied. Herein, BALB/C female mice aged 3 weeks were randomly divided into three groups (10 mice/group): oil + PBS group, DHEA + PBS group, and DHEA + APS group. Changes in the estrous cycle, ovarian tissue sections, serum levels of the hormone, blood glucose, blood lipid, and OS were studied. The intestinal microbiome was sequenced and Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between serum metabolic indexes and microflora. The results revealed that APS treatment ameliorated insulin resistance, OS, and dyslipidemia in PCOS mice. The results of 16S rDNA sequencing indicated that there were significant differences in the composition and diversity of intestinal microorganisms between DHEA and APS treatments. Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, Bacilli, Lactobacillaceae, and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A13_group were abundant in the oil + PBS group. Bacteroidota and Muribaculaceae were enriched in the DHEA + PBS group, while Rikenellaceae, Odoribacter, and Marinifilaceae were enriched in the DHEA + APS group. Furthermore, Spearman correlation analysis showed that there were close interactions and correlations between intestinal bacteria and indicators of blood glucose, blood lipids, steroid hormones, and OS in PCOS mice. Overall, the study showed that APS improved PCOS in mice by correcting serum metabolic disorders and increasing microbiome diversity, which may provide insight into understanding the pathogenesis and be a beneficial intervention for PCOS.",2024,NA

In the final linagliptin QSP model, the complicated disposition of linagliptin was characterized by a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic (PK) model with an enterohepatic cycling (EHC) component as well as target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) processes occurring in both tissues and plasma, and the inhibitory effect of linagliptin on DPP-4 was determined by the linagliptin-DPP-4 complex in the central compartment based on target occupancy principle. The integrated GIP-GLP1-glucagon-glucose-insulin system contains five indirect response models as the ""skeleton"" structure with 12 feedback loops incorporated within the glucose control system. Our model adequately characterized the substantial nonlinear PK of linagliptin, time course of DPP-4 inhibition, as well as the kinetics of GIP, GLP-1, glucagon, and glucose simultaneously in humans. Our model provided valuable insights on linagliptin pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and complicated glucose homeostasis. Since the glucose regulation modeling framework within the QSP model is ""drug-independent"", our model can be easily adopted by others to evaluate the effect of other DPP-4 inhibitors on the glucose control system.

Vitamin D supplementation significantly protected glucose homeostasis in mid-late gestation, and glycemic response to vitamin D may be dependent on basal 25(OH)D status, VDR gene polymorphism or their metabolic profiles.

Participatory action research with pre-post intervention. A two-run cycle of action and spirals from participatory action research was undertaken using a purposive sampling method to involve healthcare professionals and diabetic patients from September 2021 to June 2022. The nurse-led shared decision-making model of care was designed and implemented congruent with participatory action research principles. Quantitative measures were collected about patients' perceived involvement in shared decision-making and their understanding of the risks and benefits of using complementary and alternative medicine. Patients' outcomes of disease control (fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c) were also collected. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS software (version 28). Interviews were summarized using thematic analysis. An EQUATOR Network guideline for participatory action research supported the preparation of this paper. Comparison of pre-post intervention outcomes showed that patients' scale scores on shared decision-making involvement and understanding of the risk-benefit of using complementary and alternative medicine improved significantly after implementing the model. Fasting plasma glucose improved only slightly after a 3-month follow-up. The care model strengthens patient involvement in their disease management and makes appropriate decisions about CAM use that should reduce potentially harmful side effects or interactions between CAM and conventional medicine. The shared decision-making model of care incorporates evidence-based CAM research into practice, facilitates the standardization of CAM management in diabetes, improves care options for patients and educates nurses about CAM use in managing diabetes.

A tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolite that can strongly activate NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in macrophages, itaconate is important in a series of inflammatory-associated diseases via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, its role in type 1 diabetes is unclear. We used 4-octyl itaconate (OI), the cell-permeable itaconate derivate, to explore its preventative and therapeutic effects in mouse models of type 1 diabetes and the potential mechanism of macrophage phenotype reprogramming. The mouse models of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes and spontaneous autoimmune diabetes were used to evaluate the preventative and therapeutic effects of OI, which were performed by measuring blood glucose, insulin level, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion, histopathology examination, flow cytometry, and islet proteomics. The protective effect and mechanism of OI were examined via peritoneal macrophages isolated from STZ-induced diabetic mice and co-cultured MIN6 cells with OI-pre-treated inflammatory macrophages in vitro. Moreover, the inflammatory status of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from type 1 diabetes patients was evaluated after OI treatment. OI ameliorated glycemic deterioration, increased systemic insulin level, and improved glucose metabolism in STZ-induced diabetic mice and non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. OI intervention significantly restored the islet insulitis and beta cell function. OI did not alter the macrophage count but significantly downregulated the proportion of M1 macrophages. Additionally, OI significantly inhibited MAPK activation in macrophages to attenuate the macrophage inflammatory response, eventually improving beta cell dysfunction in vitro. Furthermore, we detected higher IL-1β production upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation in the PBMCs from type 1 diabetes patients, which was attenuated by OI treatment. These results provided the first evidence to date that OI can prevent the progression of glycemic deterioration, excessive inflammation, and beta cell dysfunction predominantly mediated by restricting macrophage M1 polarization in mouse models of type 1 diabetes.",2023,NA

In a randomised crossover study, 15 men with type 1 diabetes underwent two separate hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp experiments during Holter-ECG monitoring. One experiment included a bout of moderate-intensity cycling exercise (60 min) along with declining plasma glucose (PG; Clamp-exercise). In the other experiment, hypoglycaemia was induced with the participants at rest (Clamp-rest). We studied QTc interval, T-peak to T-end (Tpe) interval and hormonal responses during three steady-state phases: (i) baseline (PG 4.0-8.0 mmol/L); (ii) hypoglycaemic phase (PG <3.0 mmol/L); and (iii) recovery phase (PG 4.0-8.0 mmol/L). Both QTc interval and Tpe interval increased significantly from baseline during the hypoglycaemic phase but with no significant difference between test days. These changes were accompanied by an increase in plasma adrenaline and a decrease in plasma potassium on both days. During the recovery phase, ΔQTc interval was longer during Clamp-rest compared to Clamp-exercise, whereas ΔTpe interval remained similar on the two test days. We found that both exercise-related hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia induced at rest can cause QTc-interval prolongation and Tpe-interval prolongation in people with type 1 diabetes. Thus, both scenarios may increase susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias.",2023,NA

Patients with type II diabetes usually follow a self-management regime as directed by a clinician to help regulate their blood glucose levels. Today, various technology solutions exist to support self-management; however, these solutions tend to be independently built, with little to no research or clinical grounding, which has resulted in poor uptake. In this paper, we propose, develop, and implement a nudge-inspired artificial intelligence (AI)-driven health platform for self-management of diabetes. The proposed platform has been co-designed with patients and clinicians, using the adapted 4-cycle design science research methodology (A4C-DSRM) model. The platform includes (a) a cross-platform mobile application for patients that incorporates a macronutrient detection algorithm for meal recognition and nudge-inspired meal logger, and (b) a web-based application for the clinician to support the self-management regime of patients. Further, the platform incorporates behavioral intervention techniques stemming from nudge theory that aim to support and encourage a sustained change in patient lifestyle. Application of the platform has been demonstrated through an illustrative case study via two exemplars. Further, a technical evaluation is conducted to understand the performance of the MDA to meet the personalization requirements of patients with type II diabetes.",2022,NA

An imbalance in the gut microbiota and metabolites can disrupt the function of the intestinal barrier, cause changes in the permeability of the intestinal mucosa and promote the immune inflammatory response, thereby aggravating the fluctuation of blood glucose level and promoting the occurrence and development of the chronic complications of DM. Manipulating the GM and metabolites is a promising therapeutic intervention and is being studied extensively. Shenqi compound (SQC) is a traditional Chinese medicine formulation, which has been widely used to improve T2DM. Studies have demonstrated that SQC can reduce glycemic variability, alleviate the inflammatory response, etc. However, its underlying mechanism remains unknown. Therefore, in this experiment, We administered SQC to Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and evaluated its effect on blood glucose homeostasis and the intestinal mucosal barrier. We identified the profiles of the GM and metabolites with the aid of 16S rDNA gene sequencing and non-target metabolomics analysis. It showed that SQC intervention could reduce glycemic variability, regulate serum levels of glucagon and insulin, and improve injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier of GK rats. In the gut, the ratio of bacteria of the phyla Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes could be improved after SQC intervention. SQC also regulated the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae, Butyricimonas, Bacteroides, Blautia, Roseburia, Lactobacillus, and Rothia. We found out that expression of 40 metabolites was significantly improved after SQC intervention. Further analyses of metabolic pathways indicated that the therapeutic effect of SQC might be related predominantly to its ability to improve gluconeogenesis/glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, citrate cycle, and butanoate metabolism. These results suggest that SQC may exert a beneficial role in T2DM by modulating the GM and metabolites in different pathways.",2022,NA

A total of 96 T2DM volunteers who met the inclusion criteria were recruited from a hospital in Yangpu, Shanghai. Based on the blood index data of their medical examination results which comprised blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and insulin, 37 volunteers were included in the study. Exercise prescription was determined based on T2DM exercise guidelines combined with medical diagnosis and exercise test results, and the patients were randomly assigned to three groups: HIIT group, MICT group, and control (CON) group. HIIT involved one-minute power cycling (80%-95% maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max)), one-minute passive or active rest (25%-30% VO2max), and two-minute rounds of eight groups. MICT required the use of a power bike for 30 minutes of continuous training (50%-70% VO2max) five times a week. The CON group was introduced to relevant medicine, exercise, and nutrition knowledge. The exercise interventions were completed under the supervision of an exercise instructor and hospital doctors. The same indicators were measured after 12 weeks of intervention, and the results of the two tests within and between groups were analyzed for comparison. The weight index of the MICT intervention showed statistically significant within-group differences (difference = 3.52, 95% CI = 2.11-4.92, p = 0.001 < 0.01); group differences for the MICT and CON groups were also statistically significant (difference = 3.52 ± 2.09, Cd1 = -0.39 ± 1.25, p = 0.004 < 0.01). Body mass index (BMI) analysis revealed that the overall means of BMI indicators were not statistically different between groups (F = 0.369, p = 0.694 > 0.05) and the before and after values of the MICT and CON (difference = -1.30 ± 0.79, Cd1 = -0.18 ± 0.45, p = 0.001 < 0.01). No statistically significant difference was observed in the overall mean VO2max index between the groups after the 12-week intervention (F = 2.51, p = 0.100 > 0.05). A statistically significant difference was found in the overall means of the data between the two groups (difference = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.23-0.40, p = 0.001 < 0.01). Analysis of fasting blood glucose (FBG) indicators revealed statistically significant differences between the MICT and control groups (p = 0.028 < 0.05). Analysis of HbA1c and fasting insulin (FI) indicators revealed no statistically significant difference in the overall HbA1c index after the 12-week exercise intervention (F = 0.523, p = 0.598 > 0.05), and the overall difference before and after the experiment between the groups was statistically significant (F = 6.13, p = 0.006 < 0.01). No statistically significant difference was found in the FI index overall after the 12-week exercise intervention (F = 2.50, p = 0.1 > 0.05). Analysis of systolic blood pressure (SBP) revealed statistically significant difference before and after the HIIT and CON interventions (Hd7 = -1.10 ± 1.79, Cd7 = 1.2 ± 1.31, p = 0.018 < 0.05) and statistically significant difference before and after the MICT and CON interventions (Md7 = -0.99 ± 0.91, Cd7 = 1.40 ± 1.78, p = 0.02 < 0.05). The diastolic blood pressure (DBP) revealed no statistically significant within-group differences before and after. Exercise interventions applying both low-volume HIIT and MICT, with both intensity exercises designed for power cycling, improved health-related indicators in the participants; low-volume HIIT had more time advantage. The current experiment compared HIIT with MICT in a safe manner: 50% of the exercise time produced similar benefits and advantages in the two indicators of VO2max and FI. However, MICT was superior to HIIT in the two indicators of body weight (weight) and BMI. The effect of power cycling on FI has the advantages of both aerobic and resistance exercise, which may optimize the type, intensity, and time of exercise prescription according to the individual or the type of exercise program.

This study aims to confirm the preventive and therapeutic effects of undenatured type II collagen (UC II) on OA in aging db/db mice and in patients with T2DM. Firstly, aging db/db mice were randomly assigned to three groups: the UC II intervention (UC II) group, old model (OM) group and positive control group. Meanwhile db/m mice and young db/db mice were used as the normal control and young control groups, respectively. Secondly, fifty-five T2DM patients diagnosed with knee OA were randomly assigned to two groups: UC-II and placebo control groups. After a three-month intervention in both mice and T2DM patients, the subjects' gait and physical activities were assessed and the serum biomarkers including inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress factors and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were measured. Compared with the OM group mice, those in the UC II group showed a significantly greater superiority in terms of motor functions including the movement trajectories area (163.25 ± 20.3 vs. 78.52 ± 20.14 cm2), the tremor index (0.42 vs. 1.23), standing time (left hind: 0.089 ± 0.03 vs. 0.136 ± 0.04 s), swing (right front: 0.12 ± 0.02 vs. 0.216 ± 0.02 s), stride length (right hind: 7.2 ± 0.9 vs. 5.7 ± 1.1 cm), step cycle (right hind: 0.252 ± 0.05 vs. 0.478 ± 0.11 s) and cadence (14.12 ± 2.7 vs. 7.35 ± 4.4 steps per s). In addition, the levels of IL-4, IL-10, CTX- II and TGF-β in the UC II group were 1.74, 2.23, 1.67 and 1.84 times higher than those in the OM group, respectively, while the levels of MMP-3 and MMP-13 in the UC II group were half those in the OM group.

Exposure to hypoxic conditions during exercise training positively changes the physiological response in healthy subjects. Exposure to hypoxic conditions during exercise could markedly increase skeletal muscle glucose uptake compared to that in normoxic conditions. Furthermore, post-exercise insulin sensitivity of T2DM patients increases more when exercising under hypoxic than under normoxic conditions. Regular exercise under short-term hypoxic conditions can improve blood glucose control at lower workloads than in normoxic conditions. Additionally, exercise training under short-term hypoxic conditions can maximize weight loss in overweight and obese patients. Previous studies on healthy subjects have reported that regular exercise under hypoxic conditions had a more positive effect on vascular health than exercising under normoxic conditions. However, currently, evidence indicating that exposure to hypoxic conditions could positively affect T2DM patients in the long-term is lacking. Therefore, further evaluations of the beneficial effects of exercise under hypoxic conditions on the human body, considering different cycle lengths, duration of exposures, sessions per day, and the number of days, are necessary. In this review, we conclude that there is evidence that exercise under hypoxic conditions can yield health benefits, which is potentially valuable in terms of clinical care as a new intervention for T2DM patients.",2021,NA

Patients and Methods. A total of 22 patients with PCOS with phlegm-dampness syndrome, 21 PCOS patients with nonphlegm-dampness syndrome, and 20 control volunteers were selected for this study. The general index, sex hormone index, fasting blood glucose (FPG), and serum fasting insulin (FINS) were determined in each of the groups. The intestinal flora of each group was determined by the 16s rDNA high-throughput sequencing technique. Besides, the PCOS with phlegm-dampness syndrome group was treated with Jiawei Qi Gong Wan, and the changes in TCM syndrome, sex hormone index, BMI, WHR, FPG, FINS, HOMA-IR, and intestinal flora were determined before and after treatment. PCOS patients with phlegm-dampness syndrome showed characteristics of obesity and insulin resistance. There were several differences in both structure and function of the intestinal flora between PCOS patients with phlegm-dampness syndrome, PCOS patients with nonphlegm-dampness syndrome, and the control group. An imbalance in the intestinal flora may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of PCOS with phlegm-dampness syndrome and also has a specific influence on glucose and lipid metabolism, obesity, and the menstrual cycle in PCOS patients with phlegm-dampness syndrome. Besides, the imbalance is associated with a decrease in the number of butyrate-producing bacteria, an increase in the number of lipopolysaccharide-producing bacteria, and an increase in proinflammatory bacteria. The intestinal flora in PCOS patients with phlegm-dampness syndrome was found to be linked to obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperandrogenemia. Treatment with Jiawei Qi Gong Wan was found to increase the diversity of intestinal flora, increase the number of intestinal probiotics, and improve the structure and functional genes of intestinal flora which improved the state of insulin resistance, regulated endocrine metabolism, and improved the overall symptoms.

Management of diabetes depends on successful implementation of strategies to alleviate decline in executive functions (EFs), a characteristic of diabetes progression. In this review, we describe recent research on the relationship between diabetes and EF, summarize the existing evidence, and put forward future research directions and applications. Herein, we provide an overview of recent studies, to elucidate the relationship between DM and EF. We identified new screening objectives, management tools, and intervention targets for diabetes management. We also discuss the implications for clinical practice. In both types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperglycemia substantially impairs EF in people of all age groups and ethnicities. Hypoglycemia can similarly impair EF. Interestingly, a decline in EF contributes to DM progression. Glucose dysregulation and EF decline exacerbate each other in a vicious cycle: poor blood glucose control, impaired EF, diabetes management task failure, then back to poor blood glucose control. Many pathophysiological indexes (e.g., obesity, metabolic index, inflammatory and immune factors), neuropsychological indexes (e.g., compliance, eating habits, physical exercise, sleep, and depression), and genetic factors are changed by this pathological interaction between DM and EF. These changes can provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of diabetes-related EF decline. Further studies, including large-scale prospective and randomized controlled trials, are needed to elucidate the mechanism of the interaction between diabetes and EF and to develop novel strategies for breaking this cycle.",2020,NA

To determine whether weekly osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) improves physiologic measures of sympathetic tone in women with PCOS. In the second phase of a larger study from this author group, 25 women with PCOS, aged 22 to 43 years, living in Erie, Pennsylvania, were recruited to participate in a randomized, controlled evaluation of OMT intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to either an OMT intervention or control group. The OMT group received weekly manipulation of Chapman points and rib-raising for viscerosomatic reflexes associated with the ovaries, adrenal glands, and heart for 12 consecutive weeks. Physiologic measures of sympathetic tone were collected, along with metabolic, endocrine, and reproductive measurements, both before the 3-month intervention and within 1 week of completing the intervention. Measurements included heart rate and blood pressure at rest and after 15 minutes of aerobic exercise, heart rate recovery after exercise, resting heart rate variability, serum androgen levels, body mass index, fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, and menstrual cycle length. Nineteen women completed the study. Comparing pre- and postintervention parameters, women with PCOS in the OMT intervention group experienced an improvement in postexercise systolic blood pressure (135.8 vs 129.1 mm Hg) and a trend toward heart rate recovery (23.2 vs 29.4 seconds). No significant improvements were found in the control group or in any other physiologic parameters measured. No significant improvements were found in the endocrine, metabolic, or reproductive parameters measured, although free testosterone was slightly lower after 3 months of weekly OMT (5.69 vs 4.64 pg/mL).

Chikusetsu saponin IVa (CHS) had protective effects against DM and related injuries. Here we aimed to investigate the role of CHS in β cell injuries and its possible mechanism involved. Isolated rat islets, βTC3 cells and T2DM mice were used in this study. The results showed that CHS restored the secretion activity, promoted β cell survival by increasing β cell proliferation and decreasing apoptosis which induced by intermittent high glucose (IHG). In vivo, CHS protected β cell apoptosis to normalize blood glucose and improve insulin sensitivity in DM mice. Further studies showed that CHS activated Wnt3a signaling, inhibited HBP1, promoted β-catenin nuclear translocation, enhanced expressions of TCF7L2, GIPR and GLP-1R, inhibited p53, p27 and p21. The protective effect of CHS was remarkably suppressed by siRNAs against TCF7L2 or XAV-939 (a Wnt/β-catenin antagonist) in vitro and in β-catenin-/- mice. In conclusion, we identified a novel role of CHS in protecting β cell survival and regeneration by mechanisms involving the activation of Wnt3a/β-catenin/TCF7L2 signaling. Our results indicated the potential value of CHS as a possible intervention drug for T2DM.",2020,NA

This is called impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH), the cause of which is unknown. We recently proposed that IAH develops through habituation, a form of adaptive memory to preceding hypoglycaemia. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrated restoration of defective counterregulatory hormonal responses to hypoglycaemia (referred to as dishabituation) in a rodent model of IAH following introduction of a novel stress stimulus (high intensity training [HIT]). In this proof-of-concept study we sought to further test this hypothesis by examining whether a single episode of HIT would amplify counterregulatory responses to subsequent hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes who had IAH (assessed by Gold score ≥4, modified Clarke score ≥4 or Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating (DAFNE) hypoglycaemia awareness rating 2 or 3). The primary outcome was the difference in adrenaline response to hypoglycaemia following both a single episode of HIT and rest. In this randomised, crossover study 12 participants aged between 18 and 55 years with type 1 diabetes for ≥5 years and an HbA1c <75 mmol/mol (9%) were recruited. Individuals were randomised using computer generated block randomisation to start with one episode of HIT (4 × 30 s cycle sprints [2 min recovery] at 150% of maximum wattage achieved during [Formula: see text] assessment) or rest (control). The following day they underwent a 90 min hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp study at 2.5 mmol/l with measurement of hormonal counterregulatory response, symptom scores and cognitive testing (four-choice reaction time and digit symbol substitution test). Each intervention and subsequent clamp study was separated by at least 2 weeks. The participants and investigators were not blinded to the intervention or measurements during the study. The investigators were blinded to the primary outcome and blood analysis results. All participants (six male and six female, age 19-54 years, median [IQR] duration of type 1 diabetes 24.5 [17.3-29.0] years, mean [SEM] HbA1c 56 [3.67] mmol/mol; 7.3% [0.34%]) completed the study (both interventions and two clamps). In comparison with the rest study, a single episode of HIT led to a 29% increase in the adrenaline (epinephrine) response (mean [SEM]) (2286.5 [343.1] vs 2953.8 [384.9] pmol/l); a significant increase in total symptom scores (Edinburgh Hypoglycaemia Symptom Scale: 24.25 [2.960 vs 27.5 [3.9]; p<0.05), and a significant prolongation of four-choice reaction time (591.8 [22.5] vs 659.9 [39.86] ms; p<0.01] during equivalent hypoglycaemia induced the following day. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that IAH develops in people with type 1 diabetes as a habituated response and that introduction of a novel stressor can restore, at least partially, the adapted counterregulatory hormonal, symptomatic and cognitive responses to hypoglycaemia.

This study aimed to evaluate the short-term cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive intervention program for blood glucose management in different groups using a Markov model. Based on real-world data, a Markov model was developed to calculate the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The division of Markov states was in accordance with clinical practice. A three-month cycle length and a 5-year time horizon were applied. A 3% discounting rate was applied for both the costs and utilities. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) was more favorable for the male group than the female group, with an associated ICER of 104 K RMB per QALY gained. Compared with the younger group, the incremental gain of the middle-aged group was -0.062 QALY, and the incremental cost was -3,198.64 RMB; meanwhile, the incremental gain of the elderly group was -0.176 QALY, and the incremental cost was 4,485.746 RMB. The sensitivity analysis showed that the ICER is sensitive to the costs of this program and less sensitive to the discounting rate and the time horizon. The comprehensive intervention program for blood glucose management of overweight and obese patients with diabetes is cost-effective for the middle-aged male group and elderly female group, respectively. Moreover, the male group was more favorable than the female group if three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was adopted as the maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for a QALY in China.",2019,NA

This comorbidity is related to a poorer quality of life, microvascular complications, a decline in lung function, and an increase in exacerbations, as well as delayed growth and puberty. Evidence exists that physical exercise contributes to glycemic control in individuals with non-CF-related diabetes. This exercise is usually continuous with moderate intensity and long duration, which can cause muscle dyspnea and fatigue in CF individuals. Aerobic interval training (AIT) emerges as a safe and effective alternative for treating these individuals. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of AIT on glucose tolerance in children and adolescents with CF. This study will be a two-arm, prospectively registered, randomized controlled trial with blind assessors and twenty 6- to 18-year-old individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) from two different Brazilian states. People with CF will be randomly allocated to either the experimental or control group using block randomization, stratified by puberty stage,. Participants from both groups will receive an educational intervention and will be asked to continue their usual daily treatment for the full duration of the study. Those in the experimental group will perform AIT on a cycle ergometer at home three times a week, for 8 consecutive weeks. The sample characterization will include an assessment of puberty stage, socioeconomic status, dyspnea, and anthropometry. The primary outcome will be the change in glucose tolerance, while the secondary outcomes will include lung function, exercise tolerance, respiratory muscle strength, quality of life, and CF exacerbations. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, week 9, and week 17. This is the first study to evaluate the effects of AIT on glucose tolerance in children and adolescents with CF. This study will serve as a basis for guiding clinical practice and decision-making in treating glucose intolerance and CF-related diabetes (CFRD) in children and adolescents with CF.

This symposium review provides an overview of the recent work investigating whether a virtually monitored home-based high-intensity interval training (Home-HIT) intervention reduces the fear of hypoglycaemia and other common barriers to exercise in people with type 1 diabetes. What advances does it highlight? Home-HIT seems to offer a strategy to reduce fear of hypoglycaemia, while simultaneously removing other known barriers that prevent people with type 1 diabetes from taking up exercise, because it is time efficient, requires no travel time or costs associated with gym memberships, and allows people to exercise in their chosen environment. People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are recommended to engage in regular exercise for a variety of health and fitness reasons. However, many lead a sedentary lifestyle and fail to meet the physical activity guidelines, in part because of the challenge of managing blood glucose concentration and fear of hypoglycaemia. A number of strategies designed to help people with T1D to manage their blood glucose during and after exercise have been investigated. Although many of these strategies show promise in facilitating blood glucose management during and after exercise, they do not target the many other common barriers to exercise that people with T1D face, such as difficulty with cost and travel time to gyms, limited access to exercise bikes and treadmills, and a possible dislike of exercising in front of others in public places. In this symposium review, we provide an overview of ongoing research into a virtually monitored home-based high-intensity interval training (Home-HIT) programme that is designed to reduce these other common barriers to exercise. The conclusion of this review is that Home-HIT seems to offer a strategy to reduce fear of hypoglycaemia, while simultaneously removing other known barriers preventing people with T1D from taking up exercise, such as being time efficient, requiring no travel time or costs associated with gym memberships, and giving them the opportunity to exercise in their chosen environment, reducing the embarrassment experienced by some when exercising in public.",2020,NA

This study investigated the involvement of MPC1 in hepatic glucagon response, in order to identify a possible pharmacological intervention. The correlation between hepatic glucagon response and MPC1 induction was investigated in fasted mice and primary hepatocytes. The effects of ginsenoside Rb1 on MPC1 function were observed. Glucagon challenge raised blood glucose with hepatic MPC1 induction, and inhibition of MPC induction coincided with a reduced rise in blood glucose. cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) knockdown blocked glucagon-induced MPC1 expression, while CREB overexpression increased MPC1 expression. Luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and promoter mutation confirmed that CREB increased MPC1 transcription through gene promoter induction. CREB regulated transcription co-activator 2 nuclear translocation was also required for CREB to promote MPC1 induction. Glucagon shifted mitochondrial pyruvate towards carboxylation for gluconeogenesis via the opposite regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and carboxylase with respect to MPC1 induction. MPC1 induction was necessary for glucagon to promote pyruvate-driven hepatic glucose production (HGP), but glucagon failed to influence HGP from other gluconeogenic substrates routed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, independent of MPC. Rb1 blocked cAMP signalling by inhibiting AC activity and deactivated CREB by dephosphorylation, possibly contributing to inhibiting MPC1 induction to reduce HGP. CREB transcriptionally up-regulates MPC1 to provide pyruvate for gluconeogenesis. Rb1 reduced cAMP formation which consequently reduced CREB-mediated MPC1 induction and thereby might contribute to limiting pyruvate-dependent HGP. These results suggest a therapeutic strategy to reduce hyperglycaemia in diabetes.",2019,NA

This single-blind randomized clinical trial was carried out on 60 infertile participants with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) willing to be pregnant. They were randomly allocated into group 1 (n = 20) who received routine dose of CC pills (50-150 mg) for three menstrual cycles from the fifth day of menstruation for five days; group 2 (n = 20) who consumed herbal mixture daily (700 mg); and group 3 (n = 20) who used up herbal mixture along with CC for 3 months.

Blood glucose was measured preprandially and up to 150 min postprandially. Compared to CON, HIE reduced postprandial glucose concentrations at 120-150 min in obese (p < 0.001) and lean men (p < 0.05), with greater reductions in obese than lean subjects at 120 (-27.0% vs. -8.3%), 135 (-31.9% vs. -15.7%), and 150 min (-21.8% vs. -10.6%).

The aim of this article was to evaluate the effects of cycle and treadmill desks on energy expenditure and cardiovascular and biochemical indicators in sedentary workers. Materials and methods. In February 2018, six databases were searched. Both parallel and crossover design studies evaluating workplace cycle and treadmill desks compared to a conventional seated condition were included. Results. Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Cycle and treadmill desks significantly increased energy expenditure (standard mean difference [SMD] = 3.84, p < 0.001, I2 = 95%) and the heart rate (SMD = 1.68, p < 0.001, I2 = 91%), and lowered blood glucose and insulin levels (SMD = -0.54, p < 0.001, I2 = 0% and SMD = -3.13, p < 0.001, I2 = 76%, respectively).

Forty-two overweight women (age 21.2 ± 1.4 years, BMI 26.3 ± 2.5 kg·m-2) were randomized to the groups of SIT (80 × 6-s sprints + 9-s rest), and isoenergetic (300KJ) HIIT (~9 × 4-min cycling at 90% V̇O2peak + 3-min rest) and MICT (cycling at 60% V̇O2peak for ~ 61-min). Training intervention was performed 3 d·week-1 for 12 weeks. After intervention, all three groups induced the same improvement in V̇O2peak (~ +25%, p < 0.001) and a similar reduction in body mass (~ - 5%, p < 0.001). Insulin sensitivity and fasting insulin levels were improved significantly on post-training measures in SIT and HIIT by ~26% and ~39% (p < 0.01), respectively, but remain unchanged in MICT. In contrast, fasting glucose levels were only reduced with MICT (p < 0.01). The three training strategies are equally effective in improving V̇O2peak and reducing body mass, however, the SIT is time-efficient.

30451115,"Weijers Rob N M; Bekedam Dick J","The Metformin Paradox.","The Diabetes Prevention Program study results indicated that metformin therapy was not as beneficial as a lifestyle modification for delaying the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals at high risk of the disease. A key feature in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which appears in the prediabetic phase, is a significant deficiency, compared to healthy controls, in highly flexible poly-cis-unsaturated fatty acyl chains in membrane phospholipids. This deficiency lowers membrane flexibility, which in turn, reduces the amount of all functional Class I glucose transporters, and thereby reduces glucose-mediated ATP production. This leads to an increase in essentially saturated free fatty acid (FFA) levels for fatty-acid-mediated ATP production, which will set up a vicious cycle of raising the levels of essentially saturated FFAs and lowering the level of transmembrane glucose transport. Metformin suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis, which reduces the plasma glucose concentration. We hypothesize that chronic metformin treatment leads to an additional increase in essentially saturated FFAs, which causes an additional rise in membrane stiffness and hypoxia. So we propose that all these metformin-mediated activities accelerated the onset of type 2 diabetes in the participants of the metformin group in the Diabetes Prevention Program study, compared to the participants of the lifestyle-intervention group in this study. We propose that the biochemical reactions, involved in the fatty-acid-mediated ATP production, play an important part in the increase of the observed essentially saturated FFA concentrations. These statements should also extend to the metformin therapy of individuals with type 2 diabetes.",2020,NA

Although Allicin, an active ingredient of garlic has been extensively studied on carcinogen-induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in rats (Rattus norvegicus), no systematic study on the beneficial effects of generic aged garlic and specific aged garlic extract-Kyolic has been done. The present study involves rats fed chronically with two liver carcinogens, p-dimethylaminoazobenzene and phenobarbital, to produce hepatotoxicity. The aged garlic extract was characterized by UV-spectra, FTIR, HPLC and GC-MS. Biochemical and pathophysiological tests were performed by keeping suitable controls at four fixation intervals, namely, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days, utilizing several widely accepted toxicity biomarkers. Compared to the controls, remarkable elevation in the activities of lactate dehydrogenase, gamma glutamyl transferase and decline in catalase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were observed in the carcinogen fed rats. Daily administration of aged garlic extract, could favorably modulate the elevated levels of various toxicity biomarkers including serum triglyceride, creatinine, urea, bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen except total cholesterol. It also altered the levels of blood glucose, HDL-cholesterol, albumin, AST, ALT, and hemoglobin contents in carcinogen intoxicated rats, indicating its protective potential against hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in the experimental rats. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 and p53 proteins caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in garlic fed group. Kyolic exhibited additional benefits by arresting cell viability of cancer cells.

Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, which activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and increases cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production by promoting influx of pyruvate into the Krebs cycle. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on post-resuscitation neurological injury in an asphyxial cardiac arrest rat model. Asphyxial cardiac arrest was established by endotracheal tube clamping. A total of 111 rats were randomized into three groups: Sham group, Control group, and DCA intervention group. Animals in DCA intervention group were intraperitoneally administered DCA with a loading dose of 80 mg/kg at 15 min after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), whereas rats in the Control group received equivalent volume of saline. DCA treatment increased 3-day survival time, and reduced neurologic deficit scores at 24, 48, and 72 h after ROSC. It also attenuated cellular apoptosis and neuronal damage in the hippocampal cornuammonis one region by hematoxylin-eosin staining and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. In addition, DCA reduced the messenger RNA expression of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β in brain hippocampus and cortex after ROSC. Furthermore, DCA treatment significantly increased ATP production, PDH activity, and decreased blood glucose, lactate, and brain pyruvate levels after ROSC.

Most exercise interventions have targeted leisure time, but physical activity also takes place in other domains of everyday life. Active commuting represents a promising alternative to increase physical activity, but it has yet to be established whether active commuting conveys health benefits on par with leisure time physical activity (LTPA). A 6-month randomized controlled trial was designed to investigate the effects of increased physical activity in transport (bicycling) or leisure time domains (moderate or vigorous intensity endurance exercise). We included 188 overweight and class 1 obese sedentary women and men (20-45years) of which 130 were randomized to either sedentary controls (n=18), active commuting (n=35) or moderate (n=39) or vigorous (n=38) intensity LTPA. At baseline and after 3 and 6months, participants underwent a rigorous 3-day biomedical test regimen followed by free-living measurements. In a sub-sample, physical activity level and energy expenditure were monitored by means of personal assistive technology and the doubly labeled water technique. Additionally, the delivery, reception and routinization of the exercise regimens were investigated by ethnological fieldwork. One year after termination of the intervention, participants will be invited for a follow-up visit to investigate sustained health effects and continuous physical activity adherence.

Estimates of the combined prevalence of intermediate hyperglycaemia and diabetes in Bangladesh vary, and can be as high as 30% of the adult population. Despite such high prevalence, awareness and control of diabetes and its risk factors are limited. Prevention and control of diabetes and its complications demand increased awareness and action of individuals and communities, with positive influences on behaviours and lifestyle choices. In this study, we will test the effect of two different interventions on diabetes occurrence and its risk factors in rural Bangladesh. A three-arm cluster randomised controlled trial of mobile health (mHealth) and participatory community group interventions will be conducted in four rural upazillas in Faridpur District, Bangladesh. Ninety-six clusters (villages) will be randomised to receive either the mHealth intervention or the participatory community group intervention, or be assigned to the control arm. In the mHealth arm, enrolled individuals will receive twice-weekly voice messages sent to their mobile phone about prevention and control of diabetes. In the participatory community group arm, facilitators will initiate a series of monthly group meetings for men and women, progressing through a Participatory Learning and Action cycle whereby group members and communities identify, prioritise and tackle problems associated with diabetes and the risk of developing diabetes. Both interventions will run for 18 months. The primary outcomes of the combined prevalence of intermediate hyperglycaemia and diabetes and the cumulative 2-year incidence of diabetes among individuals identified as having intermediate hyperglycaemia at baseline will be evaluated through baseline and endline sample surveys of permanent residents aged 30 years or older in each of the study clusters. Data on blood glucose level, blood pressure, body mass index and hip-to-waist ratio will be gathered through physical measurements by trained fieldworkers. Demographic and socioeconomic data, as well as data on knowledge of diabetes, chronic disease risk factor prevalence and quality of life, will be gathered through interviews with sampled respondents. This study will increase our understanding of diabetes and other non-communicable disease burdens and risk factors in rural Bangladesh. By documenting and evaluating the delivery, impact and cost-effectiveness of participatory community groups and mobile phone voice messaging, study findings will provide evidence on how population-level strategies of community mobilisation and mHealth can be implemented to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases and risk factors in this population.

We examined the effect of replacing a portion of endurance training with combined resistance and/or sprint training and how this influences cardiometabolic health indicators in masters endurance cyclists. Twenty-seven well-trained male road cyclists (53.7±8.2 years) were allocated to a resistance and track sprint-cycling training group (RTC, n=10), an endurance and track sprint-cycling group (ETC, n=7) or a control endurance group (CTRL, n=10). Both the RTC and ETC groups completed a 12-week intervention of specific training while the CTRL group maintained their endurance training load. Lower limb lean mass (LLM), trunk fat mass (TFM), fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured before and after the intervention period. TFM decreased for all groups (P<0.05) while LLM significantly increased for RTC and ETC groups (P<0.05). No significant between group or time effects were observed for FBG, TC, TG, SBP, or DBP. The results suggest that replacing a portion of endurance training with 12 weeks of ETC or RTC training favourably affects body composition by lowering TFM and increasing LLM without negatively affecting cardiometabolic health indicators in well-trained masters endurance cyclists.",2016,NA

A randomized, crossover study with two 3-day laboratory visits. Center for Clinical Investigation at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Healthy chronic shift workers. The intervention included simulated night work comprised of 12-hour inverted behavioral and environmental cycles (circadian misalignment) or simulated day work (circadian alignment). Postprandial glucose and insulin responses to identical meals given at 8:00 am and 8:00 pm in both protocols. Postprandial glucose was 6.5% higher at 8:00 pm than 8:00 am (circadian phase effect), independent of behavioral effects (P = .0041). Circadian misalignment increased postprandial glucose by 5.6%, independent of behavioral and circadian effects (P = .0042). These variations in glucose tolerance appeared to be explained, at least in part, by different insulin mechanisms: during the biological evening by decreased pancreatic β-cell function (18% lower early and late phase insulin; both P ≤ .011) and during circadian misalignment presumably by decreased insulin sensitivity (elevated postprandial glucose despite 10% higher late phase insulin; P = .015) without change in early-phase insulin (P = .38). Internal circadian time affects glucose tolerance in shift workers. Separately, circadian misalignment reduces glucose tolerance in shift workers, providing a mechanism to help explain the increased diabetes risk in shift workers.",2016,NA

Therefore, little is known about the combined effect of time spent in sleep, SB and physical activity, that together constitute a composite whole, on obesity and cardio-metabolic health markers. Cross-sectional analysis of NHANES 2005-6 cycle on N = 1937 adults, was undertaken using a compositional analysis paradigm, which accounts for this intrinsic codependence. Time spent in SB, light intensity (LIPA) and moderate to vigorous activity (MVPA) was determined from accelerometry and combined with self-reported sleep time to obtain the 24 hour time budget composition. The distribution of time spent in sleep, SB, LIPA and MVPA is significantly associated with BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, plasma glucose, plasma insulin (all p<0.001), and systolic (p<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.003), but not HDL or LDL. Within the composition, the strongest positive effect is found for the proportion of time spent in MVPA. Strikingly, the effects of MVPA replacing another behavior and of MVPA being displaced by another behavior are asymmetric. For example, re-allocating 10 minutes of SB to MVPA was associated with a lower waist circumference by 0.001% but if 10 minutes of MVPA is displaced by SB this was associated with a 0.84% higher waist circumference. The proportion of time spent in LIPA and SB were detrimentally associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease markers, but the association with SB was stronger. For diabetes risk markers, replacing SB with LIPA was associated with more favorable outcomes. Time spent in MVPA is an important target for intervention and preventing transfer of time from LIPA to SB might lessen the negative effects of physical inactivity.",2015,NA

Ninety physically inactive volunteers (42±11 y, 27.7±4.8 kg.m-2) were randomly assigned to HIT or MICT group exercise classes. HIT consisted of repeated sprints (15-60 seconds, >90% HRmax) interspersed with periods of recovery cycling (≤25 min.session-1, 3 sessions.week-1). MICT participants performed continuous cycling (~70% HRmax, 30-45 min.session-1, 5 sessions.week-1). VO2max, markers of cardio-metabolic risk, and psychological health were assessed pre and post-intervention.

MODY constitutes genetically and clinically heterogeneous forms of diabetes. More than 8 different genes are known to cause MODY, among which hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A) (MODY3) and glucokinase (GCK) (MODY2) mutations are the most common. Both forms of MODY are characterised by specific beta cell dysfunction, with patients with HNF1A-diabetes having a reduced insulin secretory capacity, while patients with GCK-diabetes have a glucose-sensing defect, but preserved insulin secretory capacity. Patients with MODY are effectively treated with sulphonylurea (SU) due to very high sensitivity to these drugs, but they are also prone to develop hypoglycaemia. The objectives of this thesis were to study the pathophysiology of GCK-diabetes and HNF1A-diabetes by investigating the incretin effect, the physiological response to food ingestion and to estimate the treatment potential of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) in patients with HNF1A-diabetes. In Study I we investigated the incretin effect and the responses of islet hormones and incretin hormones to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and isoglycaemic IV glucose infusion (IIGI) in patients with GCK-diabetes, in patients with HNF1A-diabetes, and in BMI and age matched healthy individuals (CTRLs). In Study II we investigated responses of islet hormones and incretin hormones to a more physiological stimulus consisting of a standardised meal test in patients with GCK-diabetes, in patients with HNF1A--diabetes, and in BMI and age matched CTRLs. In Study III we conducted a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial investigating the glucose lowering effect and risk of hypoglycaemia during 6 weeks of treatment with the GLP-1RA, liraglutide compared to the SU, glimepiride in 16 patients with HNF1A-diabetes. At baseline and at the end of each treatment period a standardised meal test followed by a light bicycling test was performed. The results of the studies showed that patients with HNF1A-diabetes were less glucose tolerant than patients with GCK-diabetes, but both groups were more glucose intolerant than CTRLs. In spite of glucose intolerance patients with GCK-diabetes showed normal incretin effect, whereas patients with HNF1A-diabetes showed an impaired incretin effect. Patients with HNF1A-diabetes were also characterised by an inappropriate insulin response. Normal insulin sensitivity was found in both groups of diabetes patients. In the prospective intervention trial a glucose lowering effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was demonstrated with both treatments without significant difference between the treatments. The postprandial plasma glucose responses were also lower with both glimepiride and liraglutide compared to baseline without significant difference between treatments. In spite of these findings glimepiride seems to have superior glucose lowering effects according to both FPG and postprandial glucose responses. Hypoglycaemic events (plasma glucose ≤ 3.9 mM) occurred 18 times during glimepiride treatment and once during liraglutide treatment. No differences between treatments were demonstrated according to insulin and glucagon responses and gastric emptying, and counter-regulatory responses were preserved during both treatments. No effect of either treatment was seen on fructosamine or HbA1c. In conclusion, patients with GCK-diabetes show normal incretin and glucagon physiology, thus resembling healthy individuals, in spite of fasting hyperglycaemia and subtle glucose intolerance. In contrast, patients with HNF1A-diabetes exhibited noticeable glucose intolerance, beta cell dysfunction, impaired incretin effect, and inappropriate glucagon response to oral stimuli, hence resembling patients with type 2 diabetes. However, normal responses of incretin hormones and normal insulin sensitivity were found in patients with HNF1A-diabetes. Six weeks of treatment with glimepiride or liraglutide demonstrated glucose lowering effects. This effect was greater with glimepiride, although insignificant, but at the expense of a higher risk of hypoglycaemia (predominantly mild). GLP-1RAs may have a place in treatment of patients with HNF1A-diabetes, especially when hypoglycaemia is a problem. Future studies are required to clarify this.",2015,NA

Therefore, expectations are high that telehealth can help alleviate prevailing challenges in health care delivery. However, in order to translate current research to policy and facilitate adoption by patients and health care providers, there is need for compelling evidence of the effectiveness of telehealth interventions. Such evidence is gathered from rigorously designed research studies, which may not always be practical in many real-world settings. Our aim was to summarize current telehealth evaluation strategies and challenges and to outline practical approaches to conduct evaluation in real-world settings using one of our previously reported telehealth initiatives, the Diabetes Connect program, as a case study. We reviewed commonly used current evaluation frameworks and strategies, as well as best practices based on successful evaluative efforts to date to address commonly encountered challenges in telehealth evaluation. These challenges in telehealth evaluation and commonly used frameworks are described relevant to the evaluation of Diabetes Connect, a 12-month Web-based blood glucose monitoring program. Designers of telehealth evaluation frameworks must give careful consideration to the elements of planning, implementation, and impact assessment of interventions. Evaluating performance at each of these phases is critical to the overall success of an intervention. Although impact assessment occurs at the end of a program, our review shows that it should begin at the point of problem definition. Critical to the success of an evaluative strategy is early planning that involves all stakeholders to identify the overall goals of the program and key measures of success at each phase of the program life cycle. This strategy should enable selection of an appropriate evaluation strategy and measures to aid in the ongoing development and implementation of telehealth and provide better evidence of program impact. We recommend a pragmatic, multi-method, multi-phase approach to telehealth evaluation that is flexible and can be adapted to the characteristics and challenges unique to each telehealth program.",2014,NA

Adaptive exercise-induced changes to plasma thiol redox and orthinine status were measured for trained subjects while at rest in a fasting state. A multi-linear regression model was developed to predict changes in glucose tolerance based on a panel of plasma metabolites measured for naïve subjects in their untrained state.

Our objective was to study 1-year effects of recombinant human methionyl leptin (metreleptin) in 5 patients with RMS and 10-year effects in 2 of these patients. We conducted an open-label nonrandomized study at the National Institutes of Health. Patients were adolescents with RMS and poorly controlled diabetes. Two patients were treated with escalating doses (0.02 up to 0.22 mg/kg/d) of metreleptin for 10 years, including 3 cycles of metreleptin withdrawal and reinitiation. In all 5 patients, 1-year effects of metreleptin (0.22 mg/kg/d) were studied. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI) z-scores were evaluated every 6 months. HbA1c decreased from 11.4% ± 1.1% at baseline to 9.3% ± 1.9% after 6 months and 9.7% ± 1.6% after 12 months of metreleptin (P = .007). In patients treated for 10 years, HbA1c declined with each cycle of metreleptin and rose with each withdrawal. BMI z-scores declined from -1.4 ± 1.8 at baseline, to -2.6 ± 1.6 after 12 months of metreleptin (P = .0006). Changes in BMI z-score correlated with changes in HbA1c (P < .0001).

Association of obesity with insulin resistance and related cardiometabolic problems is well established. Traditionally, adipose tissue in visceral fat depot has been considered a major culprit in development of insulin resistance. However, growing body of the literature has suggested that adipose tissue in subcutaneous fat depot, not only due to larger volume but also due to inherent functional characteristics, can have significant impact on development of insulin resistance. There are significant differences in functional characteristics of subcutaneous abdominal/truncal versus gluteofemoral depots. Decreased capacity for adipocyte differentiation and angiogenesis along with adipocyte hypertrophy can trigger vicious cycle of inflammation in subcutaneous adipose tissue and subsequent ectopic fat deposition. It is important to shift focus from fat content to functional heterogeneity in adipose tissue depots to better understand the relative role of subcutaneous adipose tissue in metabolic complications of obesity. Therapeutic lifestyle change continues to be the most important intervention in clinical practice at any level of increased adiposity. Future pharmaceutical interventions aimed at improving adipose tissue function in various subcutaneous depots have potential to help maintain adequate insulin sensitivity and reduce risk for development of insulin resistance complications.",2013,NA

A1C was collected at baseline and quarterly. This analysis included 45 participants who wore the RT-CGM ≥4 weeks. Analyses examined the RT-CGM data for common response patterns-a novel approach in this area of research. It then used multilevel models for longitudinal data, regression, and nonparametric methods to compare the patterns of A1C, mean glucose, glycemic variability, and views per day of the RT-CGM device. There were five patterns. For four patterns, mean glucose was lower than expected as of the first RT-CGM cycle of use given participants' baseline A1C. We named them favorable response but with high and variable glucose (n = 7); tight control (n = 14); worsening glycemia (n = 6); and incremental improvement (n = 11).

Education sessions are organised through a regional diabetes management network, and performed by trained registered nurses at close quarters. The educational approach is theoretically based (socio-constructivism, social contextualisation, empowerment, action planning) and reproducible, thanks to curricula and handouts for educators and learners. The subjects will be recruited from five hospital outpatient settings all over Reunion Island. The main eligibility criteria include: age ≥18 years, type 2 diabetes treated for more than one year, HbA1c ≥ 7.5% for ≥3 months, without any severe evolving complication (ischaemic or proliferative retinopathy, severe renal insufficiency, coronaropathy or evolving foot lesion), and absence of any major physical or cognitive handicap.

The graphical user interface (GUI) design is presented by construction based on a series of simple, short design criteria based on fundamental human factors engineering and includes the use of user feedback and focus groups comprising nursing staff at Christchurch Hospital. The overall design maximizes ease of use and minimizes (unnecessary) interaction and use. It is coupled to a protocol that allows nurse staff to select measurement intervals and thus self-manage workload. The overall GUI design is presented and requires only one data entry point per intervention cycle. The design and main interface are heavily focused on the nurse end users who are the predominant users, while additional detailed and longitudinal data, which are of interest to doctors guiding overall patient care, are available via tabs. This dichotomy of needs and interests based on the end user's immediate focus and goals shows how interfaces must adapt to offer different information to multiple types of users. The interface is designed to minimize real and perceived clinical effort, and ongoing pilot trials have reported high levels of acceptance. The overall design principles, approach, and testing methods are based on fundamental human factors principles designed to reduce user effort and error and are readily generalizable.",2012,NA

Androgen levels were significantly higher in T1D subjects than in the control group (T, 68.8 ± 23.4 vs. 46.1 ± 20.8 ng/dL). Four subjects (7.4%) were affected by PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria. No correlation was evident between HbA1c% and androgen levels. No significant differences were evident between subjects on MI or CSII therapy. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed a direct and independent effect of age and body mass index on T levels. T levels were also negatively affected by birth weight. Androgen levels are significantly increased in T1D adolescents and young women treated by intensive insulin therapy.

Exercise capacity, maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)), body composition (DXA scans), blood pressure (BP), and blood lipid profile were determined before and after the intervention period for 22 soccer-group subjects (SG) and 10 waiting list controls (CO). In addition, time-motion analyses, HR measurements, and pedometer recordings were performed during street soccer training and daily-life activities. During a 60 min 4 versus 4 street soccer session 182 ± 62 intense running bouts were performed; mean HR was 82 ± 4% HR(max) and HR was >90% HR(max) for 21 ± 12% (±SD) of total time. On a day without training the participants performed 10,733 ± 4,341 steps and HR was >80% HR(max) for 2.4 ± 4.3 min. In SG, VO(2max) was elevated (p < 0.05) from 36.7 ± 7.6 to 40.6 ± 8.6 ml/min/kg after 12 weeks and incremental cycle test performance was improved (p < 0.05) by 81 s (95% CI: 47-128 s). After 12 weeks, fat percentage (19.4 ± 8.5 to 17.5 ± 8.6%) and LDL cholesterol (3.2 ± 1.1 to 2.8 ± 0.8 mmol L(-1)) were lowered (p < 0.05) in SG.

Consequently, more young women are entering pregnancy with body mass indices of at least 30 kg/m(2). While higher maternal weight entering pregnancy is related to several adverse pregnancy outcomes, some of the strongest and most compelling data to date have linked prepregnancy obesity to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The mechanisms by which excess maternal weight influences metabolic dysfunction in pregnancy are similar to those in obese nonpregnant women; adipocytes are metabolically active and release a number of hormones implicated in insulin resistance. Heavier mothers are also more likely to have higher glucose levels that do not exceed the cutoff for GDM, but nevertheless predict poor perinatal outcomes. Longer-term complications of GDM include increased risk of maternal type 2 diabetes and offspring obesity. Promising intervention studies to decrease the intergenerational cycle of obesity and diabetes are currently underway.",2011,NA

Therefore, to better define the relationship between weight cycling, energy homeostasis, and future weight gain, we examined associations between frequent intentional weight loss and hormonal profiles in postmenopausal women. This cross-sectional study evaluated the relationship between a history of frequent weight loss and biomarkers, including serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and ghrelin, as well as sex steroid hormones. We hypothesized that frequent intentional weight loss would be associated with changes in normal appetite and body weight regulatory hormones, favoring increased appetite and weight gain. One hundred fifty-nine healthy, weight stable, sedentary, overweight, postmenopausal women who had been recruited for an exercise intervention participated in this study. History of intentional weight loss (frequency and magnitude) was assessed by questionnaire. Hormonal assays were performed by radioimmunoassay (insulin, leptin, ghrelin, estrogens, androgens, and dehydroepiandrosterone), chemiluminescence immunoassay (insulin-like growth factor-1), and immunometric assay (sex hormone binding globulin). Analysis of variance and regression analyses were used to investigate the relationship between weight loss history and metabolic hormones. A higher degree of weight cycling, characterized by the frequency of intentionally losing more than 10 lb, was associated with an appetite-stimulating hormonal profile, including higher concentrations of ghrelin (P trend = .04), lower glucose (P trend = .047), and to some extent, lower insulin (P trend = .08). Frequent weight loss was also associated with lower androgen concentrations, including androstenedione (P trend = .02), testosterone (P trend = .04), and free testosterone (P trend = .01). No independent associations between the concentrations of leptin or estrogens and weight cycling were observed.

Previous studies have suggested that the maternal environment, in particular a reduction in maternal insulin sensitivity, contributes significantly to fetal growth. Regular aerobic exercise, through an effect on maternal insulin sensitivity, may influence offspring size by regulating nutrient supply to the fetus. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of aerobic exercise training in the second half of pregnancy on maternal insulin sensitivity and neonatal outcomes. We conducted a community-based, randomized, controlled trial of exercise in pregnancy. Eighty-four healthy nulliparous women (mean +/- sd, age, 30 +/- 4 yr; body mass index, 25.5 +/- 4 kg/m(2)) participated in the study. Subjects participated in a home-based stationary cycling program from 20 wk gestation to delivery. Maternal insulin sensitivity, neonatal auxology, body composition, and growth-related peptides in cord blood were measured. Offspring of exercisers had lower birth weight (sd score, control, 0.23 +/- 0.8; exercise, -0.19 +/- 0.9; P = 0.03) and body mass index at birth (sd score, control, 0.40 +/- 0.9; exercise, -0.01 +/- 0.09; P = 0.04). The reduction in maternal insulin sensitivity in late gestation was not affected by exercise (P = 0.45) and was unrelated to offspring size. Exercise offspring had lower cord serum IGF-I (P = 0.03) and IGF-II (P = 0.04). Regular exercise was associated with lower birth weights and reduced cord concentrations of growth-related peptides, suggesting an influence of exercise on endocrine regulation of fetal growth.

MPILC exploits two key factors: frequent glucose readings made possible by continuous glucose monitoring technology; and the repetitive nature of glucose-meal-insulin dynamics with a 24-h cycle. The proposed algorithm can learn from an individual's lifestyle, allowing the control performance to be improved from day to day. After less than 10 days, the blood glucose concentrations can be kept within a range of 90-170 mg/dL. Generally, control performance under MPILC is better than that under MPC. The proposed methodology is robust to random variations in meal timings within +/-60 min or meal amounts within +/-75% of the nominal value, which validates MPILC's superior robustness compared to run-to-run control. Moreover, to further improve the algorithm's robustness, an automatic scheme for setpoint update that ensures safe convergence is proposed. Furthermore, the proposed method does not require user intervention; hence, the algorithm should be of particular interest for glycemic control in children and adolescents.",2010,NA

Moreover, we found that insulin-stimulated serine-phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta was higher in insulin plus hCG-treated rats but lower in DHEA-treated rats. Furthermore, basal and insulin-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 was higher in DHEA-treated rats than in controls. Notwithstanding that both the hyperandrogenism and the hyperinsulinemia synergistic with hCG-treated rats displayed the typical traits of human polycystic ovary syndrome, there is a divergence in the insulin-signaling pathway in the ovarian tissue, which may have a role in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome.",2009,NA

To correlate social and cultural status with the phenotypic expression (body weight and ovulation) and with androgen and insulin levels of PCOS. University department of medicine. Two hundred and forty-four consecutive PCOS women. All studied patients completed a simple questionnaire to indicate their mean family income and their school education. Ovulation was assessed by measurement of serum progesterone on day 22 of a spontaneous or induced menstrual cycle. Levels of blood testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, insulin, and blood glucose were evaluated. In the low to medium income group, 21% of patients had ovulatory PCOS, but the prevalence of the same PCOS phenotype was 43% in patients with high income. In patients with low education, only 12% presented with ovulatory PCOS compared with 47% of the patients with high education status. Mean family income negatively correlated with body mass index, waist circumference, insulin, and insulin resistance. Serum progesterone correlated negatively with insulin and insulin resistance. In an ethnically homogeneous PCOS population, high socioeconomic status was associated with a higher prevalence of the ovulatory phenotype. Differences in ovulatory status between the social classes seem to be related to differences in insulin levels and fat quantity and distribution.",2009,NA

Plasma glucose, insulin, lipids, ASP, C3, CRP, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were measured. Plasma ASP, CRP, insulin, cholesterol, and nonesterified fatty acids were increased significantly in women with PCOS compared with in controls. Although each of these parameters also was statistically significantly correlated directly with BMI, the association with PCOS status was independent of BMI, with increased plasma values at all levels of BMI. In control subjects, CRP and C3 correlated with glucose and triglyceride, only CRP correlated with nonesterified fatty acids and cholesterol, and ASP correlated with triglyceride (again, all correlations were significant), whereas in subjects with PCOS, several of these correlations were lost, as a result of consistently higher levels of CRP and ASP regardless of BMI. Levels of ASP, CRP, and lipids are increased in subjects with PCOS, regardless of the level of BMI. The increased ASP level in both PCOS groups suggests that the ASP metabolism may be altered.",2009,NA

Physical activity remains an important component of prevention and treatment for obesity, T2DM, and IR. Studies in adults show cardiovascular fitness (CVF) to be more important than obesity in predicting IR. We recently demonstrated that a school-based fitness intervention in children who were overweight can improve cardiovascular fitness, body composition, and insulin sensitivity, but it remains unclear whether accurate assessment of fitness could be performed at the school or outside of an exercise laboratory. The purpose of the study was to determine if a new methodology using measurement of cycling power could estimate cardiovascular aerobic fitness (as defined by maximum oxygen consumption; VO(2)max) in middle school children who were overweight. Thirty-five middle school children who were overweight (mean age 12 +/- 0.4 years) underwent testing on a power sensor- equipped Cycle Ops Indoor Cycle (IC), as well as body composition by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and VO(2)max by treadmill determination. Insulin sensitivity was also estimated by fasting glucose and insulin. Maximal heart rate (MHR) was determined during VO(2)max testing, and power produced at 80% of MHR was recorded. Spearman's rank correlation was performed to evaluate associations. Mean power determined on the IC at 80% of MHR was 129 +/- 77 watts, and average power at 80% MHR divided by total body weight (TBW) was 1.5 +/- 0.5. A significant correlation between watts/TBW was seen for VO(2)max (ml/kg/min) (p = 0.03), and significant negative correlation was seen between watts/TBW and fasting insulin (p < 0.05). In middle-school children who were overweight, there was a significant relationship between the power component of fitness and cardiovascular aerobic fitness (measured by VO(2)max). This more accessible and less intimidating field-based measure of power may prove useful in predicting changes in cardiovascular fitness. Thus, accurate assessment of childhood aerobic fitness may be achievable by measurement of power, possibly within the school environment at substantially less cost and effort than laboratory-based measurements.",2007,NA

The study utilized a multisite, control vs. intervention, repeated-measures design within four states in Australia. Fifty-six community pharmacies, 28 intervention and 28 control, were randomly selected from a representative sample of urban and rural areas. Intervention pharmacies delivered a diabetes service to patients with Type 2 diabetes, which comprised an ongoing cycle of assessment, management and review, provided at regular intervals over 6 months in the pharmacy. These services included support for self monitoring of blood glucose, education, adherence support, and reminders of checks for diabetes complications. Control pharmacists assessed patients at 0 and 6 months and delivered no intervention. A total of 289 subjects (149 intervention and 140 control) completed the study. For the intervention subjects, the mean blood glucose level decreased over the 6-month study from 9.4 to 8.5 mmol/l (P < 0.01).

There is an urgent need to understand how Indigenous primary care systems are organised to deliver diabetes services to those most in need, to monitor the quality of diabetes care received by Indigenous people, and to improve systems for better diabetes care. The intervention featured two annual cycles of assessment, feedback workshops, action planning, and implementation of system changes in 12 Indigenous community health centres. Assessment included a structured review of health service systems and audit of clinical records. Main process of care measures included adherence to guideline-scheduled services and medication adjustment. Main patient outcome measures were HbA1c, blood pressure and total cholesterol levels. There was good engagement of health centre staff, with significant improvements in system development over the study period. Adherence to guideline-scheduled processes improved, including increases in 6 monthly testing of HbA1c from 41% to 74% (Risk ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.71-2.10), 3 monthly checking of blood pressure from 63% to 76% (1.27, 1.13-1.37), annual testing of total cholesterol from 56% to 74% (1.36, 1.20-1.49), biennial eye checking by a ophthalmologist from 34% to 54% (1.68, 1.39-1.95), and 3 monthly feet checking from 20% to 58% (3.01, 2.52-3.47). Medication adjustment rates following identification of elevated HbA1c and blood pressure were low, increasing from 10% to 24%, and from 13% to 21% respectively at year 1 audit. However, improvements in medication adjustment were not maintained at the year 2 follow-up. Mean HbA1c value improved from 9.3 to 8.9% (mean difference -0.4%, 95% CI -0.7;-0.1), but there was no improvement in blood pressure or cholesterol control. This quality improvement (QI) intervention has proved to be highly acceptable in the Indigenous Australian primary care setting and has been associated with significant improvements in systems and processes of care and some intermediate outcomes. However, improvements appear to be limited by inadequate attention to abnormal clinical findings and medication management. Greater improvement in intermediate outcomes may be achieved by specifically addressing system barriers to therapy intensification through more effective engagement of medical staff in QI activities and/or greater use of nurse-practitioners.",2007,NA

At exhaustion, the concentration plasma norepinephrine was elevated by 29%. A decrease was seen with caffeine treatment in blood potassium after 5 min of cycling and at exhaustion (by 3% and 2%, respectively). Caffeine treatment increased epinephrine, fatty acids, lactate and norepinephrine at different times during test session and led to insulin-resistance.

Before and after the intervention (16 h after last training bout), a sequential hyperglycemic (90 min at 11, 18, and 25 mM) clamp was performed. An intravenous bolus of 5 g of arginine was given at the end. Training increased Vo(2 max) 17 +/- 13% and decreased heart rate during submaximal exercise (P < 0.05). During the 3 mo of sedentary lifestyle, insulin and C-peptide responses to the clamp procedures were unchanged in both moderate and low secretors. Likewise, no change in beta-cell response was seen after training in the low secretors (n = 5). In contrast, moderate secretors (n = 9) showed significant increases in beta-cell responses to 18 and 25 mM hyperglycemia and to arginine stimulation. Glucagon responses to arginine as well as measures of insulin sensitivity and Hb A(1c) levels were not altered by training.

An open clinical trial with a non-intervention parallel group was carried out on 12 young, obese women. After randomization, six volunteers were selected to the surgical intervention consisting of large-volume liposuction; the other six women were considered as the non-intervention group. Metabolic profiles and insulin tolerance tests to assess insulin sensitivity were performed on all volunteers before intervention or non-intervention and 21 - 28 days afterwards. There were a significant decrease in glucose (4.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, p < 0.05) and uric acid (250.8 +/- 56.2 vs. 224.0 +/- 53.4 micromol/l, p < 0.05) levels after liposuction; insulin sensitivity improved after the surgical intervention (4.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 5.3 +/- 0.8 %/min, p = 0.046). In conclusion, surgical removal of subcutaneous fat by large-volume liposuction led to an improvement in insulin sensitivity and a decrease in glucose and uric acid concentrations.",2002,NA

In women with PCOS or IH, the OGTT was repeated at the fourth month of treatment. Fasting and OGTT-stimulated levels of glucose, insulin, and C peptide. Both fasting and OGTT-stimulated levels of insulin and C peptide were significantly higher in women with PCOS and in those with IH than in controls. Placebo did not modify parameters of glucose metabolism. Flutamide was capable of significantly blunting fasting and OGTT-stimulated secretion of insulin only in women with IH.

Training consisted of 3-min bouts of cycling interspersed with 2 min at a lower exercise intensity. Intensities were 80 and 40% of pretraining maximal power output (W(max)) in the high-intensity (HI) and 40 and 20% W(max) in the low-intensity (LI) group. The insulin sensitivity index (IS(index)) was similar in the HI and LI group before the training intervention [mean (SD) -0.1898 (0.058) and -0.1892 (0.045), respectively]. After training, the IS(index) was -0.2358 (0.051) (P = 0.005 vs pretraining) in the HI group and -0.2050 (0.035) (P = 0. 099 against pretraining) in the LI group.

Controls did not receive triptorelin for ethical reasons. Serum GH, IGF-1, IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), insulin, glucose, total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, E2, and gonadotropin levels. Basal and ACTH-stimulated steroid precursors were measured. Patients with idiopathic hirsutism were identified by normal serum androgen levels (n=17). Those with functional ovarian hyperandrogenism (n=15) were identified by an increase in the serum testosterone level that normalized during gonadal suppression, whereas those with functional adrenal hyperandrogenism (n=8) were identified by an initial increase in the testosterone level that persisted during gonadal suppression. The adrenal hyperandrogenism group had increased IGF-1 levels compared with the control, idiopathic hirsutism, and ovarian hyperandrogenism groups. Patients with ovarian hyperandrogenism had normal TGF-1 concentrations, but their IGFBP-3 concentrations were lower than those of controls. No differences were observed in GH levels between any of the groups. These results persisted when the influence of age was corrected for. The IGF-1 axis appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of hyperandrogenism, especially in patients with adrenal hyperandrogenism, who have a clear increase in IGF-1 levels.

The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism involved in animal survival despite significantly enhanced liver injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (175-225 g) were treated with isopropanol (ISOP, 2.5 ml/kg, 25% aqueous solution, po) 24 hr prior to CCl4 (1 ml/kg, ip) administration. Plasma enzymes (ALT and SDH), hepatic glycogen levels, and [3H]thymidine (3H-T) incorporation into hepatonuclear DNA were measured during a time course (0-96 hr) after CCl4 administration. Liver sections were examined for histopathology and cell cycle progression by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry. Maximum injury was observed at 36 hr in both the groups as indicated by elevated plasma enzyme levels and by histopathology. The extent of injury in the ISOP + CCl4 group was higher than that in the H2O + CCl4 group. Plasma enzyme activity returned to control levels by 60 hr, indicating recovery from injury in both groups. Maximum 3H-T incorporation occurred at 48 hr in both groups (ISOP + CCl4; vehicle + CCl4), indicating maximum stimulation of S-phase synthesis. PCNA studies revealed a corresponding stimulation of cell cycle progression. The wave of S-phase synthesis and cell cycle progression returned to control levels in the H2O + CCl4 group by 60 hr but continued up to 72 hr in the ISOP + CCl4 group. These findings support the hypothesis that in response to increased infliction of CCl4 injury by isopropanol, augmented stimulation of cell division and tissue repair restrain the progression of injury and restore hepatic structure and function, thereby allowing the rats to survive. Further, antimitotic intervention with colchicine (1 mg/kg, ip) led to decreased S-phase synthesis, followed by 60% lethality in the isopropanol-pretreated group in contrast to 40% lethality in the group receiving CCl4 alone (H2O + CCl4). These findings suggest that greater stimulation of tissue repair restrains the progression of ISOP-enhanced infliction of CCl4 liver injury and accounts for recovery from enhanced liver injury and animal survival. The findings are consistent with a two-stage model of toxicity wherein liver injury is linked by progression or regression of injury, which is governed by the extent of tissue repair to the final outcome.",1996,NA

The hyperglycemia increases in recovery and is accompanied by hyperinsulinemia. Because these adaptations are unique to intense exercise, we tested the physiological significance of the hyperinsulinemia by exercising six fit, postabsorptive young male subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) after overnight glycemic normalization by iv insulin, keeping its infusion rate constant during and for 2 h after 100% maximum VO2 cycle ergometer exercise to exhaustion (12 min) (no postexercise hyperinsulinemia). Their responses were compared with those of matched control subjects studied on two separate occasions, once without intervention (physiological hyperinsulinemia, n = 6) and again with a 0.05 U/kg iv bolus at exhaustion (postexercise supraphysiological hyperinsulinemia, n = 5). In all three study protocols, Ra increased by 7-fold, and Rd by 4-fold at exhaustion, and Ra declined in early recovery at the same rates. Therefore, the early recovery hyperinsulinemia is not required to return Ra to preexercise levels, and excessive hyperinsulinemia does not accelerate this decline. We infer that the catecholamine increments and decrements are the prime regulators of Ra (correlations of Ra vs. norepinephrine or epinephrine, P < 0.001 in the three studies), with a smaller contribution from the concurrent hyperglucagonemia. Rd, in contrast, was significantly affected by insulin. In the IDDM subjects, Rd remained at the same rate as Ra through most of recovery, resulting in sustained hyperglycemia and decreased glucose MCR, vs. the control subjects. This hyperglycemia compensated for the abnormal MCR, such that Rd was comparable to that in the control subjects. With the insulin bolus, the Rd elevation was sustained longer compared to the study without bolus, resulting in mild hypoglycemia successfully counterregulated by an increase in Ra. Thus, the principal regulators of the marked exercise increase and rapid recovery decrease in Ra are probably the catecholamines. The postexercise hyperinsulinemia is required for the MCR response and to return plasma glucose concentrations to preexercise levels. Different therapeutic strategies are required in persons with IDDM undergoing strenuous vs. moderate exercise, because of their inability to generate the postexercise hyperinsulinemia.",1993,NA
